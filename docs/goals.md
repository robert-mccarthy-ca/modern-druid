# üåç Modern Druid Project Goals

The Modern Druid Project pursues transformative environmental, social, and economic objectives through integrated carbon farming, biochar production, and community engagement. Our goals align tightly with key UN SDGs to ensure measurable impact.

## üåø Core Impact Goals

### 1. Draw Down Atmospheric Carbon

* **Durable Carbon Sequestration (Biochar):** Convert biomass into biochar, locking carbon in soils for centuries to millennia while improving soil structure, water retention, and fostering additional soil organic carbon accumulation around biochar particles.
* **Living Carbon Sequestration (Agroforestry):** Establish and maintain syntropic food forests with sustainable irrigation; these living systems sequester carbon continuously, accelerating as trees and understory biomass mature and canopy cover expands.

### 2. Provide Free, Nutrient-Dense Food & Medicine
* **Perennial Food Forests:** Design open-access gardens with fruits, nuts, and other edible plants alongside medicinal species. No pesticides, herbicides, fungicides or chemical fertilizers.
* **Community Education:** Offer on-site workshops, signage, and guides detailing which plants are available, identification, harvest timing, edibility, uses, and preservation methods to empower self-harvesters.

### 3. Make Carbon Farming a Legitimate Career

* **Equitable Revenue Sharing:** Distribute 50% of gross revenues to employees as wages and performance bonuses. No worker earns less than 50% of the highest-paid position on each farm.
* **Land Ownership:** At the end of the project the food forest is given to the employees that built it.

### 4. Restore & Protect Ecological Health

* **Soil Regeneration:** Rebuild soil structure and fertility using deep taproots, biochar amendments, and mixed-species plantings.
* **Biodiversity Enhancement:** Plant diversity promotes pollinators and other insects. Buffer strips allow for unmanaged natural habitats and wildlife corridors. Microbial diversity helps build mychorrizal networks.

### 5. Responsible Irrigation

* **Sustainable Water Harvesting:** Atmospheric or ocean water harvesting using a combination of passive systems (radiative cooling, fog nets, etc) or powered ones (dehumidifiers, dessicants, etc). Could include desalination if near an ocean. Water supplementation without damaging groundwater stores. Ponds for water storage. Long term project being added to every year.
* **Fixed Irrigation:** Fixed and automated irrigation, the land should never be left to dry out, soil dieback is crucial to avoid. In winter this would be in the form of snowmaking, a lack of winter snow cover can be nearly as damaging as a lack of summer rain.

### 6. Conduct Long-Term Regenerative R\&D

* **Ecosystem Science:** Investigate soil microbiomes, rock weathering, and fungal networks.
* **Innovation Hubs:** Pilot greenhouse systems using kiln waste heat and JMS/IMO aeroponics for continuous learning.

### 7. Abolish Industrial Agriculture

* **Outcompete With Quality:** Provide certified organic, free from pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Clean quality food.
* **Outcompete With Price:** Our revenue comes from carbon, so we can give our food away for free. Let's see them compete against zero.

## üåé UN SDG Alignment & Implementation

| SDG                                          | Action Plan & Metrics                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. No Poverty**                            | Jobs paying living wages; farm ownership transitions at project end.                                                                   |
| **2. Zero Hunger**                           | Free, year-round access to diverse perennial crops in community zones.                                                                 |
| **3. Good Health & Well-being**              | Eliminate synthetic agrochemicals; foster soil and human microbiome health.                                                            |
| **8. Decent Work & Economic Growth**         | Excess food is available to local entrepeneurs to capitalize on free of charge, fostering local business growth.                       |
| **9. Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure** | Agriculture becomes climate resilient, capable of withstanding drought.                                                                |
| **10. Reduce Inequalities**                  | Jobs pay developed world wages regardless of location.                                                                                 |
| **11. Sustainable Cities & Communities**     | The food supply shifts to a carbon negative one, grown locally instead of being imported from distant locations.                       |
| **12. Responsible Consumption & Production** | Food production while improving soil fertility, not destroying it.                                                                     |
| **13. Climate Action**                       | Measurable and meaningful reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide.                                                                    |
| **15. Life on Land**                         | Biodiversity focus provides food and habitat for pollinators and wildlife while also serving as a living seed bank.                    |
| **17. Partnerships for the Goals**           | Seek NGO partnerships to bring food and economic security to developing nations.                                                       |
