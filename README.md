# The Modern Druid Project

Welcome to my pet project. I decided to try to design a solution to combat climate change, to answer the question **"How would I solve this problem if I could?"** What would such a solution even look like? Here's my attempt. I've called it The Modern Druid Project because more people speak geek these days than nerd and it captures the heart of the project. Also, as I live in Canada, this is based on Canadian climates, but should be applicable to every climate zone warm enough to grow plants, the specific plants would just change.

### **Executive Summary (Read This First)**
**What it is.** A replicable, open‑source **carbon‑removal farm** that pairs **syntropic agroforestry** (biomass + free food + soil carbon sequestration) with **biochar** (durable carbon dioxide removal), verified by rigorous **0–3 m soil** and **biochar lab testing** MRV, funded by **carbon credits + biochar sales**, and governed by an **equitable pay + land‑transfer model** that trains crews to **spawn new farms**. By giving every farm a new farm financing budget, we can achieve exponential growth.

**How it works.** We grow food forests with high‑biomass coppice alleys. Part of the biomass becomes **biochar** (durable credits sold for revenue), the rest stays in place to feed the soil. At least **half the char stays on‑farm** to accelerate fertility, water resilience, and future biomass. Food is **free pick‑your‑own** to remove logistics friction and deliver community benefits immediately.

**Why this wins.** The system compounds: **better soils → more biomass → more char/credits → more investment in soils and irrigation**, on a workforce model that **prioritizes wages (50% of revenue)** and **transfers land** to workers over time. Every profitable farm **spawns more farms**, with a fixed revenue share devoted to financing new farms, which in turn spawn new farms once mature and so on. Exponential growth while paying fairly, providing genuine prosperity and free food to communities anywhere. The carbon markets are international, so if this can be made to work in a place as expensive as Canada, it can work throughout the rest of the world as well, and for the same wages regardless of developed or developing nation status, immune to political inaction and all but the most targetted political opposition. A carbon removal project with exceptional cobenefits, with up to 14 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals being met in the process and an exponential growth curve by way of the new farm expansion budget.

﻿# **The Modern Druid Project: A Blueprint for Planetary-Scale Carbon Drawdown and Food Security**

### **Executive Summary — Detail**

The short version is to build food forests to produce both free food and biomass, earning revenue and profit from carbon in the form of carbon removal credits from both soil growth (Vera + CCB) and from converting biomass to biochar (Puro.Earth), plus biochar sales. These carbon markets are international and voluntary marketplaces, so if it can work in Canada, it can work anywhere else with a comparable or lower cost of living, regardless of national borders, but to scale up globally, we need a global price on carbon. At least half of the biochar would be kept to reapply to the soil every year. And paying the employees equitably, half the revenue, with the land being given to the employees at the end of the 20 year project cycles. New land gets purchased and projects started on it after the land is fully planted out, sustainably irrigated and profitable. The continued existence of the company in communities is reliant on new land to improve. When the work is done, we leave, passing the land to the locals that worked those farms, generating high employee motivation and retention while bringing real generational wealth to these communities. All profitable farms would also have an expansion budget to create new farms, ideally run by the promoted workers who then get replaced by new trainees and themselves start training new employees of their own. Every farm spawns new farms, which is key to achieving an exponential growth curve.

Focusing on the carbon revenue streams alone would allow us to forgo the standard logistical challenges of harvesting, distribution, storage and food sales altogether and let us manage a much larger area per employee than we could if we relied on food as a revenue source. It would also allow us to give the food away for free, providing very valuable community co-benefits and public awareness of carbon dioxide removal. Let the public pick their own damn food while we focus on carbon drawdown and creating a modern analog of Terra Preta. In fact, by focusing on carbon revenues and not being greedy, by paying equitably and passing the land back to the local populations, we open up a whole new world of community benefits, it would allow us to directly contribute to 14 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals out of the box, with the other 3 reachable through future R&D and expansion. Co-benefits also happens to be key to getting a good price on our soil carbon credits. Paid for by the polluters destroying the planet. Besides, paying for the privilege of eating doesn't need to be a business model anymore, so let's end that. Let's see industrial chemical based agriculture compete with free, local, fresh, organic and pesticide free. Drive a healthy food revolution by simple market forces: compete with free or go out of business. A funding path to revolutionizing our food supply. Carbon credits worth buying even if you don't care about the climate.

Why is this necessary? According to official temperature records, Sault Ste. Marie's (my hometown) average annual temperature between 1961 and 1990 was 4.2 degrees Celcius. Toronto's was 7.2 degrees Celcius over the same period. 2024 Sault Ste. Marie's average was 7.3 degrees Celcius. Modern Sault Ste. Marie is warmer than pre-Boomer Toronto. For further scale, below 0 is classified as permafrost. Sault Ste. Marie has warmed by 3/4 of the difference between pre-Boomer times and permafrost. This is the difference between growing apples, strawberries and blueberries and growing peaches, grapes and nectarines. This isn't a small change. Global carbon emissions continue to increase, the Amazon is collapsing, the permafrost is melting (and in places burning), the boreal forests worldwide are collapsing and burning, coral reefs worldwide are dying, glaciers are melting and of course to top it off, rainfall patterns are shifting to something never before seen, something that no ecosystem has ever had to adapt to, that no ecosystem on the planet is prepared to withstand. A lot more carbon is on its way, potentially hundreds of ppm worth of CO2 and/or methane. An additional 2 parts per million of methane would trap more heat than all the carbon dioxide we've added since the Industrial Revolution. We're running out of time. We may have already run out of time, the melt has started, with roughly 7% of the world's permafrost regions in some stage of melt today. 

In 1750, before the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels were 278 parts per million. Today they are 425 parts per million. Safe levels as defined by the IPCC are below 350. Even if levels that high are indeed still safe, that gives us 75 parts per million of legacy carbon dioxide to remove before the rest of the permafrost melts or burns, because there's far more carbon in the permafrost than in our atmosphere today. Today there is about 900 billion tons of carbon (GtC) in the atmosphere, whereas the permafrost rocks in at 1460-1600 billion tons of carbon. That's an insane amount of carbon, the equivalent of 685 to 751 ppm, which can come out of the ground in 2 ways, as carbon dioxide or as methane. Aerobic decomposition of that thawed organic matter produces CO2, anaerobic gives a more even split of CO2 versus CH4 (methane). Methane is a **MUCH** more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide unfortunately, 120-150 times as powerful during the first year of emission, dropping to 85 times over a decade because methane decays into carbon dioxide, but it takes decades. Currently we're releasing it faster than it decays, hence the rising levels. Methane levels today are 1.9 parts per million and it makes up about 16% of human caused warming, CO2 being the biggest culprit at 64% with 425 parts per million. It doesn't take very much more permafrost loss before we have a very very big problem. It wouldn't thaw all at once, but with about 7% of what was permafrost now melting, we're in trouble. A 1% release as methane ends life as we know it because it will cause enough heating that the rest of it melts. Humans don't survive dozens of ppm of methane, much less hundreds. Plus of course, marine permafrost and methane hydrate deposits that are at risk of melt containing another potential 1000 ppm or so of methane. With the now melting permafrost, collapsing Amazon rainforest and burning of the world's boreal forests, we need to be prepared to remove literally hundreds of ppm of atmospheric CO2 over the coming decades and lower the temperature to the point where the permafrost refreezes. Plus we have to sequester enough to bring down the existing CO2 levels back to pre-industrial levels.  Even if we went net zero tomorrow, our CO2 levels wouldn't drop to safe levels for another 250 years. Our ecosystems and the agriculture that depends on that won't last that long, removal is no longer optional. In 2024, durable carbon removal markets delivered 318,600 tons of CO2. As in kilotons of carbon dioxide removal when we need to remove teratons (trillions of tons) of CO2 in the next few decades to have a chance of children today living to see 50. And we need to do it before the methane hits the atmosphere. That's the scale of the challenge.

If we can hit 20 tons/hectare/year of woody biomass for biochar, which has been achieved without biochar or natural farming inputs in Canada but without the food, that should give us something on the order of 17 tons/hectare/year of CO2 removal in biochar alone, plus any soil carbon growth, which should be substantial since higher latitude plants sequester more of their carbon below the soil than above. So if we could maintain that average globally over all the world's farmland, we'd be able to remove about 80 billion tons per year in biochar alone (about 10 ppm), plus soil carbon gains. That's a path to parts per million per month of drawdown. As these farms continue to mature and the soil fertility continues to increase, this has the potential to sequester even more. This could be extended to non-farmland, and is even adaptable to kelp farms, and with sufficient desalination or atmospheric water harvesting, even non-arable land could be managed. This solution has the potential to meet that challenge, to provide a path to drawing carbon dioxide levels back down to pre-industrial levels, our last known stable configuration and keep them there. It will still require global cooling solutions such as marine cloud brightening to refreeze the permafrost and prevent further methane release until that happens. But first, we need to prove it can work at all, sequestering meaningful quantities of carbon while still providing enough food to justify agricultural land use, and then use that to push for a global price on carbon removal. The only way we can utilize that much farmland is by producing at least as much food as conventional farming, and by driving the existing farmers out of business. We also need to measure how long it takes for the system to mature enough to match or outperform conventional farming, which will determine how fast these farms could be rolled out even if we found global government levels of funding to do so. And with free food as part of the deal, people might be a little more receptive to having to pay for carbon removal.

Finally, to share all of this information for free. Everything, from which forms to fill out to file for a carbon project, walkthroughs of the actual work, our carbon results, sales, building and site plans, engineering plans for the kilns, to any other research and development that we do, everything. The goal would be to have all internal training for new sites done as online videos to allow for faster training and deployments than would be possible with in person training. As mentioned above, these would be made freely available to the public. This is a problem where others doing this too are competing with us, not against us. We will expand as fast as we can, but this is still a process measured in years and decades before enough capacity comes online even in the best case scenarios. The more people doing this the better.

So there you have it, that's my crazy idea on how to solve it. A path to restoring our atmosphere to pre-industrial levels through meaningful levels of carbon sequestration. Global food security through free, fresh, organic, chemical free food. A way to stabilize our climate. A path to reversing climate change. A path where humans don't go extinct. Paid for by polluters. And all of that by gardening like a beast, having fancy bonfires and daring to solve the problem. Pick your own damn food.

# **1.0 Agroforestry**

The Modern Druid agroforestry engine is designed to do three things at once:

1. Grow **biomass as the primary crop** (fuel for biochar and carbon credits).
2. Establish a **diverse, free-access food forest** as the support species.
3. **Build soil carbon and resilience** through syntropic cycling and biochar return.

Unlike conventional syntropic systems that treat food crops as the primary, here **biomass is the crop**. Food is the “support species,” free to anyone who wants to harvest it. This flips the economic logic: wages are paid from carbon credits, while the community benefits from free food, shade, biodiversity, and resilience services.

Food harvest logistics basically disappear: fruit, herbs, and greens are picked directly by local people or fall to feed the soil, we simply need parking lots and wide paths. That makes management simpler and cheaper, while simultaneously positioning the project as a civic resource. We are **paid by polluters**, but communities enjoy the food, the jobs, the cooling, the trails, and the resilience.

## **1.1 Operational Engine: Agroforestry System Design**

### **Layout & Planting Strategy**

* **16 m repeating pattern:**

  * **Tree Row (2 m):** Multi-strata food forest. Highest layer = pollardable biomass trees (walnut, chestnut, poplar). Below = edible trees (apple, pear, plum, mulberry, nut shrubs). Understory = berries, herbs, nitrogen fixers.
  * **Path/Herb Strip (3 m):** Walkable public path, also herbaceous mulch strip with comfrey, mint, oregano, alfalfa. Access for CTL and foot traffic.
  * **Coppice Alley (8 m):** Dense high-biomass species (willow, locust, hybrid poplar) harvested every 1–3 years for biochar.
  * **Path/Herb Strip (3 m):** Mirror of the first.

* **Phased Planting:**

  * **Year 0 – Pioneer Phase:** Flail-mow entire site; broadcast seedballs with pioneer mix (daikon, chicory, sunflower, comfrey, black locust, plus quick-growing herbs/greens).
  * **Year 1–2 – Framework:** Plant Tree Rows + Coppice Alleys with seedballs. Install irrigation. Begin species diversification.
  * **Year 3+ – Succession:** Select seed from best-performing plants for new seedball batches. Introduce new perennials annually. Begin pollarding of upper canopy. Rotate coppice cuts across alleys for sustainable biomass.

---

### **Annual Task Breakdown & Workflows**

Seedball Production:
All plants are grown from seed. Seed balls are basically balls of clay, organic matter and seeds, rolled into either single species or multi species balls, dried on a rack and planted by simply throwing them on the ground. Plants are a lot faster to seed when you just toss a ball into your fresh mulch pile, either during the initial planting with a flail mower, or during pruning passes. The equipment required is a rotary drum system, similar in style to a concrete mixer, drying racks and bins for storage, all low tech, scalable, relatively cheap. Can be done in Winter after the season's seeds have all been collected, or whenever other workflows are slow.

Initial Site Prep:
Flail mow everything to the ground and plant a selection of deep taprooted fast growing pioneer species, both annual and perennial. Examples in this area might be giant sunflowers, black locust, daikon radish, chicory, comfrey. The goal of this is to drive carbon channels into the land everywhere, to grow carbon through a deep soil column and provide drought resistance.

Planting the Food Forest:
The rows and alleys would be planted once again by seedball. The main rows have pollardable species as the upper layer of the food forest, with edible species beneath. These edible species' are what get chopped and dropped for mulch as support species, leaving the most vigorous to grow larger. Alleys would be coppicable species, grown for biochar.

Annual Maintenance:
Key harvests are the coppice alleys and the pollarded rows. The coppicing is most efficient around 3-4 years between cuts, but we'd opt for every other year. This lets us get a good yield while allowing enough light in for the food species. The annual hard pruning of the rows would occur in the same years as the coppicing, allowing for plants that fruit on second year wood to produce food. This pruning would take place in the spring and be done mechanically with a tractor, shearing off 70-80% of the branches with a cutter of some kind. Pollarded species would probably follow a similar schedule. This would be alternated between rows, so every other row and alley would get done each year. The selective breeding takes place throughout the growing season, keeping the most vigorous, best yielding or just tastiest plants and planting more of them. The life cycle of these edible species will be kept relatively short, replacing older plants with the best of the newer ones grown from the best performing old ones. Herbaceous strips get mown several times a season for every row. Natural farming inputs, especially the microbial ones, are applied throughout the growing season. Biochar is also added to the soil during pruning or mowing passes. Irrigation is installed once the site is planted out and the local budget allows it. Expansion to other sites only starts after the irrigation is running sustainably.

### **Advanced Irrigation & System Protection**

Permanent **frost-proof sprinkler grid** doubles as irrigation, foliar feed delivery, snowpack protection, and wildfire defence.

* **Water Harvesting:** Radiative panels, fog nets, or AWG systems. Restores water cycle resilience.
* **Power:** On-site solar/wind for pumps & electric fleet (minimizes emissions).
* **Storage:** Ponds/swales buffer supply for irrigation, quenching, and foliar sprays.
* **Protection Functions:**

  1. **Irrigation:** 1–2 mm/day coverage across whole site.
  2. **Foliar Inputs:** JMS/KNF broadcast via sprinklers.
  3. **Snowmaking:** Insulates soils against winterkill.
  4. **Wildfire Mitigation:** Emergency sprinkler operation as defensible barrier.

### **Equipment Snapshot (field-side)**

* **Light fleet:** ATV/mini-tractor + flail mower, sprayer, spreader.
* **Heavy harvest:** 150–200 hp tractor with coppice header, round baler.
* **Handling:** Compact Track Loader (CTL), telehandler, trailers.
* **Kiln suite:** Tiltable flame-cap kilns, crusher/grinder, automated quench.
* **Nursery/inputs:** Greenhouse, rotary tumbler, brewing totes.
* **MRV:** Soil corers, drones, emissions sensors.

### **2.0 Biochar**

#### **2.1 The Biochar Production Engine: Scale, Speed, and Verification**

The heart of the Modern Druid Project's revenue model is a highly efficient, semi-industrialized biochar production facility designed for safety, scalability, and the rigorous Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) required for carbon markets.

Biochar is not merely a product; it is the central mechanism that transforms sustainable biomass into permanent carbon removal and soil regeneration. It is the catalyst for the project's virtuous cycle.

**What is Biochar?**
Biochar is a carbon-rich, stable solid material produced by heating biomass (wood, agricultural residues) in a high-temperature, low-oxygen environment—a process called **pyrolysis**. This ancient practice, inspired by Amazonian *Terra Preta* soils, is now a leading-edge carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology, and comprises the bulk of global durable carbon removals to date. The difference between charcoal and biochar is the completeness of combustion, charcoal stops before volatalizing off all the oils that contribute to the flavour while biochar cooks those off too, typically at a higher temperature.

**The Pyrolysis Process: Locking Carbon Away**
During pyrolysis, the volatile components of the biomass are driven off as syngas, which in a flame cap kiln burns off above the biomass,consuming the oxygen in the process which prevents oxygen from reaching the biochar (hence the term flame cap), leaving behind a material that is primarily **elemental carbon**. This carbon structure is highly resistant to decomposition.
*   **Permanence:** Biochar persists in soils for **centuries to millennia**, effectively locking away the carbon absorbed by the plants from the atmosphere during their growth.
*   **Verifiability:** This permanence is rigorously quantified and verified against standards like **Puro.earth** with annual batch testing, allowing it to be sold as a durable carbon removal credit.

**The Multiplicative Benefits of Biochar**
The value of biochar extends far beyond carbon sequestration. Its application creates a cascade of soil benefits:
1.  **Soil Fertility & Nutrient Retention:** Biochar's incredibly high surface area and porosity act like a coral reef for soil life, as well as retaining nutrients and water that would otherwise leach away.
2.  **Water Resilience:** Biochar can hold up to **5 times its weight in water**, dramatically increasing the soil's water-holding capacity.
3.  **Pollution Reduction:** By retaining nutrients in the root zone, biochar prevents fertilizer runoff into waterways.
4.  **A Circular Economy:** The model transforms waste biomass into a high-value product, closing the nutrient loop and eliminating waste.
5.  **Soil Carbon:** Biochar applied to the soil increases the rate of carbon sequestration, above and beyond the carbon that biochar itself adds.

**From Carbon to Revenue: The Biochar Value Streams**
*   **Primary Revenue (Carbon Credits):** The permanent sequestration of CO₂ is verified and sold as high-value carbon removal credits on the voluntary market (e.g., Puro.earth). This is the project's financial anchor.
*   **Secondary Revenue (Product Sales):** Bulk biochar is sold as a soil amendment to farmers, vineyards, and landscapers. Retail bagged biochar provides a higher-margin product for home gardeners. Other sales streams include things like aggregate replacement in asphalt and concrete, filters, animal feed additives, and more.
*   **Tertiary Revenue:** Soil carbon produces additional carbon removal credits, although at a lower price point than durable methods such as biochar.
*   **On-Farm Benefits:** The portion of biochar applied to project lands is an **investment in future yield and resilience**. 

#### **2.2 The CharHouse & Production Workflow**

**The CharHouse: Design for Safety and Efficiency**
The pyrolysis process is housed in a dedicated, purpose-built structure—**The CharHouse**.
*   **Structure:** A simple, robust pole barn (~1,500 sq ft) with a high roof peak (~20 ft).
*   **Passive Airflow & Safety:** The lower ~1 meter of the walls are open, covered with heavy-duty steel mesh for passive air intake and intrinsic safety (prevents gas accumulation even in the event of complete power failure).
*   **Active Ventilation:** A large, variable-speed **exhaust fan** is mounted high in the gable end, ensuring operator safety.
*   **Emissions Monitoring (MRV Critical):** The exhaust stack is fitted with ports for **Continuous Emissions Monitoring (CEM)** sensors to provide proof of clean, complete pyrolysis for certification.

*   **Emissions Monitoring — Details:** In addition to CEM ports, the kiln building functions as a **large ventilated fume hood**. We **periodically measure** and log **CO₂, CO, VOCs, and particulate matter (PM)** from the exhaust stack. These logs are kept for **transparency and compliance** even when not required for credit calculations.

**Numbers at a Glance (Throughput):**  
• **Per 5 yd³ kiln run:** ~**0.96 t** biochar; needs ~**3.19 t** dry biomass; ~**2.81 tCO₂e** credited (@ $200 CAD/tCO₂e ≈ **$562**).  
• **Annual example (2000 t biomass):** **627 runs** → ~**600 t** biochar → ~**1 760 tCO₂e**.

**The Kilns: Engineered for Throughput**
The system uses a bank of 8+ **insulated, tiltable, quench-ready flame cap kilns**.
*   **Design:** Each kiln is a robust, cylindrical vessel (~5 cubic yard capacity) mounted on a pivotal axle.
*   **Insulation:** Ceramic wool insulation lines the kiln walls for faster pyrolysis and reduced fuel consumption.
*   **Quench System:** An overhead water pipe with solenoid valves and spray nozzles for each kiln.
*   **Tilt Mechanism:** A hydraulic ram allows for safe, controlled tilting for unloading.

**The Workflow: From Bale to Biochar**
The process is designed for a 3-person crew to manage 8 kilns simultaneously.
1.  **Loading:** The CTL operator moves bales of biomass to the CharHouse and loads the kiln with a grapple.
2.  **Ignition & Pyrolysis:** The kiln is lit and topped up by hand during the ~3-hour active burn using additional bundled piles of coppiced or pollarded biomass, with the bundling being a key labour saving component. Lifting a bundle onto a fire is a lot faster than picking up individual pieces and is how existing harvesting equipment and techniques produce it.
3.  **Quenching:** An **automated quench system** is triggered to spray water into the kiln, halting the process. From an operator perspective, hit the quench button once it's ready and go back to the other kilns still running.
4.  **Draining:** Quench water drains to a **settling pond** for reuse as a liquid amendment.
5.  **Unloading:** The kiln is tilted over a **dump trailer**.
6.  **Transport & Processing:** The full trailer is driven to the **Biochar Processing Building** for drying, weighing, milling, and packaging. It is important to do this in a separate building to keep the biochar dust from grinding away from the flames and to keep the flames away from stored biochar.

**Achieving Scale: The Numbers**
With this system, a 3-person crew can achieve:
*   **Daily Biochar Production:** **~5.6 tonnes of biochar per day.**
*   **Annual Campaign (12-week season):** **~403 tonnes of biochar.**
This volume comfortably exceeds certification thresholds and generates significant revenue. Planning for workers to be able to keep 4+ kilns running each is reliant on the feedstock being organized into bales or otherwise bundled for ease of transport and loading. One employee will be needed for trailer hauling, biomass refilling and other support tasks for the main operators to maintain productivity.

#### **2.3 Expanded Biochar Sales Strategy**

**Biochar Pricing & Volumes (CAD):**  
• **Volume conversions:** **140–170 ft³/t**, i.e., **5.2–6.5 yd³/t**.  
• **Ramp note:** Biochar sales commence **after CFIA registration** in Canada, which can take **> 1 year**; but sales channels can open sooner depending on jurisdiction.

The long-term strategy is to move up the value chain.
*   **Phase 1 (Year 2): Bulk Sales.** Sell certified biochar in 1-tonne bulk bags to local farms and landscapers at a competitive $800/tonne.
*   **Phase 2 (Year 3+): Value-Added Retail.** Invest in processing and packaging for consumer markets.
    *   **Product:** Milled, screened biochar in 5L, 20L bags.
    *   **Price Point:** $1,500 - $2,000 per tonne equivalent.
    *   **Channels:** Garden centers, hardware stores, and online direct sales.
    *   **Branding:** Leverage the "Beyond Organic" and "Carbon Negative" story.

**Assumption:** In the full-production financial model, we assume a conservative split: 200 tonnes sold in bulk ($800/t) and 100 tonnes sold at retail prices ($1,500/t).

#### **2.4 Strategic Expansion: Industrial Biomass Partnerships**

Biochar can be made from larger woody biomass such as logging and milling scraps, but the flame cap kilns are not a good fit for woodchips or sawdust. Soil on the other hand can readily absorb woodchips or sawdust as a mulch, so non-kilnable feedstock could potentially be accepted and applied to the soil directly. In areas with large amounts of forestry for example, thousands (or more) of tons of biomass just in slash piles in a typical clearcut, wood that is typically burned as waste so it doesn't create a huge fire risk as it dries. This would entail adding the logistics of getting the wood back to the hub, but as a sense of scale, a single clearcut could yield as much biomass as a 100 hectare farm does in a year. Since the biochar needs to be applied to land (or any other permanently sequestered manner) before we can claim the carbon credits, we would be limited by the amount that could reasonably be applied to the land each year and what could be sold. Accepting milling waste would be another effective way to get large quantities of biomass, ideally free, give them a free place to dump their waste where it gets disposed of responsibly.

#### **2.5 MRV Protocols (Soil & Biochar)**

**Soil Carbon MRV (0–3 m):**  
• **Baseline:** Full-depth soil cores to **3 m**, segmented **0–30 cm**, **30–100 cm**, **100–300 cm** at **GPS-tagged** points prior to disturbance.  
• **Handling & Labs:** Depth-labelled, sealed samples analyzed by **accredited third‑party labs** for SOC, bulk density, moisture (pH/texture optional).  
• **Ongoing Monitoring:** **Annual** resampling at the same georeferenced locations, with periodic new random points to improve dataset integrity.  
• **Documentation:** Core photos and soil‑pit photos for education and QA.

**Biochar MRV:**  
• **Batch Logs:** Input biomass (wet/dry), kiln temps and duration, output biochar (post‑quench and dried).  
• **Biochar Testing:** Annual (or when feedstock changes) for **C, ash, volatiles (PAHs), moisture, heavy metals** to align with **Puro.Earth**/**CFIA**/**OMRI** expectations.  
• **Emissions:** Periodic stack sampling (**CO₂, CO, VOCs, PM**).  
• **MRV Database:** Central digital repository with weekly cloud backups; public summaries published for transparency.

**The Hub-and-Spoke Model:**
1.  The Modern Druid regional hub operates its agroforestry system as its primary feedstock source.
2.  It partners with local industries (forestry, agriculture), accepting their waste biomass at the nearest hub site.
3.  The hub's centralized facility processes this additional feedstock.
4.  The additional biochar would be sold if possible or applied to the soil otherwise.

**Financial & Operational Impact:**
*   **Increased Carbon Credit Production:** Utilizes kiln infrastructure beyond base capacity.
*   **Scalability:** Grows carbon removal output without acquiring more land.
*   **Labor Scaling:** Requires hiring additional staff for a second kiln shift.

### **3.0 Workflows**

The workflows can be separated largely into two groups, the global company and the individual farms. For the global company we have various R&D efforts, training videos, public relations, assorted administrative tasks, design documents, and starting farms in new regions. Initially this would be undertaken by the pilot site, but would eventually split off into its own distinct company. The goal of the global parent company would be to do the things that are applicable to all sites, such as training videos or research, and to start new sites as funding arrives, either externally through pre-sales of credits, or internally through the royalties from profitable sites. The goal of the individual farms would be to grow enough food to justify using farmland for a carbon capture project, sequestering enough carbon dioxide to remain profitable, and spawning new farms. Below are the workflows for the individual sites.

#### **3.1 Seedball Production**

Seedballs are essentially little balls of moistened clay powder mixed with some type of compost and some soil and seeds that are then dried and stored for use. To use them, drop them on the ground. Literally, that's it. The whole point of them as far as we're concerned is that they're easy to deploy in a spreader, they can be made with synergistic mixes of plant species, and they don't require any form of tillage. Just broadcast after mowing. But in order to do that, you first need to be able to make seedballs fast enough to be practical.

Making seedballs requires powdered clay, topsoil, compost (or other inocculant like IMO or JMS) and seeds. Seeds would likely be sourced from various seed vendors initially unless there was a local source. Beyond the initial generation of plants though, seeds are saved from the best performing seeds. These plants are planted out in the annual plantings, and if they outperform their older counterparts, they replace them, otherwise they get culled and used as mulch.

Rotary drums are easily built, low tech devices that can work anywhere and produce hundreds of thousands of seedballs per day. We're going ot need several million, so this would be a non-trivial task, but one that could be done any time of year. Drying racks would also be needed to dry all those seedballs, so space would need to be allocated for it and for storage once dry.

This would need to be done on a regular basis throughout the project life, but a lot of it would need to be done when starting a new farm.

#### **3.2 Initial Site Survey**

Before carbon credits can be issued for soil carbon, a baseline needs to be measured. This is done through soil samples to a depth of 3m, which is about as deep as portable corers can go. The point of starting with a deep taprooted selection of plants with minimal lateral root competition is that we would be growing soil throughout that entire soil column.

Before changing the land, microbial sampling for JMS (Jadam Microbial Solution) and IMO (Indigenous Microorganisms) from Jadam and Natural Farming systems needs to take place. This mostly involves collection of soil samples and culturing out the biology involved. This should also take place in as many healthy ecosystems and soils as is locally available. Combined results will be used as our microbial inoculants. Gathering new soil samples for culturing will be a long term task on an occasional basis during the growing season.

This should only have to be done once per site.

#### **3.3 Initial Site Prep**

The first step after we have our baseline measured is to use a flail mower to mow everything down to the soil, perhaps a few centimeters below to take out as many plant crowns as possible with a minimum of soil disturbance. This would be followed immediately by a deep taprooted selection of plants, mostly perennial but with some annuals, including a coppicable biomass species. An example for my area would be something like black locust (coppicable tree) every 1m, comfrey (perennial shade tolerant high biomass herbaceous plant) interspaced at 1m, giant sunflowers (early biomass annual that leaves a deep taproot to decompose and feed the soil), chicory (deep taprooted perennial) and daikon radish (annual that does very well at soil decompaction left to rot in place) in between with a smattering of lower growing perennials for ground cover. All of which would be from seed using seedballs. The workflow there being someone walks behind the flail mower dropping seedballs with the desired species at the desired spacing.

Flail mowing with a small tractor can be expected to clear 2.5 to 10 hectares per day depending on the size of the tractor, the vegetation in place and the land being covered. This would be done by one employee while one or more others plant (toss) the seedballs at the desired spacing. The expectation is that the initial site prep can be done in a single season before planting out the rows and alleys proper.

This should only have to be done once per site.

#### **3.4 Planting the Rows and Alleys**

The food forest would be planted out as a row and alley system where the tree rows have a large selection of species. In syntropic agroforestry the concept is to use different canopy layers overlapping, emergent, high medium and low strata species intermingled so the same position can be growing multiple crops at different heights allowing for a higher planting density than conventional monocrop orchards. Herbaceous strips are also used between the rows and alleys alongside paths for people to access the rows. The rows would be aligned north-south so all rows get light from both sides.

For the rows, our emergent species would be pollardable species with a high pollard, for example, paulownia, hybrid poplar, willow or hazelnut, but experiment with all available species to see. Below that we would have our various fruit and nut trees, with the tastiest and best producing allowed to grow to high strata, the others chopped down to allow for new trees grown from the best trees that are growing in the low canopy. The low strata would be comprised of saplings and perennial species like blueberries, raspberries and so forth, including some form of ground cover such as herbs or low growing berries like strawberries.

For the alleys we want a selection of coppicable trees such as paulownia, black locust or willow that would get harvested every other year, allowing for more yield and less annual labour. The trees would be spaced to optimize production at 2 year rotations. Between those trees, shade tolerant perennial species, ideally edible, would be planted as a ground cover.

For the herbaceous strips that are destined for mowing and to be used as mulch, we will be picking high biomass perennials such as comfrey, chickory, jerusalem artichokes and any other high biomass plants that grow well in the area.

Planting would be done with a flail mower and seedballs, much like the initial site prep. Depending on how long from initial site prep the replanting takes, this may require a pass with a brush saw first to cut down any larger trees or other plants. For select plants, specific cultivars may be desired and would have to be planted from seedling or so forth, for example, if you want McIntosh Red apples, you need to get that cultivar. Any such plants would be used as labour allows and grown from seed afterwards. For plants taht do not grow true from seed, such as apples, they would be planted densely and selected based on taste, vigor and yield.

The layout would be row, path, herbaceous strip, alley, herbaceous strip, path and then repeating with the next row. The exact widths of each would have to be hammered out, probably after consulting with an agroforestry expert, but would need to accommodate a mulch layer on either side of the tree row, a path wide enough for people to pass by, and a combined path and herbaceous strip wide enough to use at least light tractors to speed harvesting.

Initial planting would only need to be done once, but once established, the site would continue to get planted every year, just not as intensively.

#### **3.5 Irrigation**

After the site is planted, irrigation needs to be installed. Not just any irrigation though, we want to irrigate about a millimeter per day that sees no precipitation and we want to do it year round. We also want to be able apply foliar applications of biology in particular, but with other natural farming inputs as well. The goal isn't to maximize production, the goal is to boost production while preventing severe drought conditions, to prevent growth from stopping just because our broken precipitation patterns resulted in no rain for 3 months and to protect from wildfires in the summer and keep snow on the ground to insulate plant roots. We don't need a lot of it, but we do need it to be there regardless of weather and precipitation patterns. 

Once the Amazon finishes collapsing, the source of much of North America's clouds goes away and dramatic precipitation pattern changes are expected. Changing ocean currents are already shifting the monsoons. The warmer the atmosphere, the more water is in the air, but the fewer clouds we have, so we can expect larger rain events and longer dry spells worldwide. The precipitation patterns our ecosystems evolved with are not something we can rely on going forward, which is why we need to be harvesting water from either the air or the sea. Groundwater can be used in the meantime, but setting up water harvesting is the next step after the irrigation is set up, unless there is no water for irrigation, in which case it needs to happen first. In either case, the site is not complete without both irrigation and a sustainable water supply. To save water, ponds should be set up as well to capture runoff and store harvested water.

Among the more promising atmospheric water harvesting technologies today are radiant cooling panels which passively condense water from night air, fog nets for foggy areas, compressors based dehumidifiers, and sorption and desorption from hydrogels. Water storage in the form of ponds could be modified to have the water harvesting panels and so forth directly above them, preventing evaporative losses and draining right into the storage area. How much will be needed is going to vary per site, but 1mm of supplemented rain (or about 1cm of snow) is the target goal, enough to prevent drought conditions and wildfires from starting and having an emergency supply in the event of an external wildfire. The food forests cannot be allowed to simply burn as the rest of our ecosystem collapses and burns, we need to manage the land, now and for centuries to come before this gets fixed.

Once irrigation is set up fully, the foliar feeding would be run through it, reducing future work elsewhere and improving foliar regimens.

#### **3.6 Natural Farming Inputs**

Natural Farming is a practice popular in Asia, Japan and Korea especially, with these particular practices being of Korean origin. Korean Natural Farming (KNF) and Jadam Natural Farming practices specifically. Soil health is highly dependant on soil microbiology, and both of these practices have a strong focus on fostering it, both in quantities and in diversity. Indigenous Microorganisms (IMO) is a KNF input made with either rice or leaf mold soil grown out aerobically in a medium such as cracked grains and is used as an inocculant for soil and plants alike, being used both as a soil drench and as a foliar application for plants. We would plan to do both, as an aerobically brewed liquid, known as liquid IMO. Jadam Microbial Solution (JMS) is similar in nature, but is an anaerobic culturing using leaf mold soil and cooked potatoes, so yields different microbes. This is only for soil however, not as a foliar spray. We would apply both to the soils on a regular basis, since our soils are not expected to remain the same, they're expected to change and improve over time with continuous applications of biochar year after year.

Other natural farming inputs would include Fermented Plant Juice (FPJ), Oriental Herbal Nutrients (OHN), Brown Rice Vinegar (BRV), sea salt, and Jadam Liquid Fertilizer (JLF). The FPJ and OHN would need to be made on site, as would IMO and JMS. Jadam Liquid Fertilizer is plant material in a barrel with a few handfuls of soil and filled with water, left to ferment anaerobically for several months, producing a liquid fertilizer that gets drained off, the result of the soil life digesting the plant material. This is used in the biochar preparation. The vinegar could be made, but probbaly not worth it, probably just buy it. Brown sugar is another component used when making FPJ.

Not from Natural Farming practices, but Johnson Su compost would also be made, which is a low temperature static aerobic compost made using worms and kept moist over a period of a year, so would have to be made on site. It would be used as an inocculant, not as a bulk nutrient, we would be using mulch instead of compost for that purpose. Johnson Su compost is a fungally dominant compost and is used as an inocculant as a compost extract. The standard directions are to apply it once only, but as we're rapidly growing and changing our soil, we'll apply it regularly alongside the liquid IMO, both as a foliar and as a soil inocculant, or alongside JMS for soil inocculation.

The inocculants need to be started immediately to start growing soil life as soon as possible after the site soil survey. All of the inputs would need to be made on a regular basis and would be limited to the growing season for all but OHN, which can be made any time of year. The inputs themselves are shelf stable, so they can be done in large batches at least.

#### **3.7 Foliar Sprays**

Foliar sprays are sprays applied to the foliage, so the whole plant above ground gets sprayed. For liquid IMO and the Johnson Su extracts, this is to boost and diversify the plant microbiomes as well as the soil microbiome. FPJ, OHN, BRV and sea salt are also used in KNF to provide nutrients through the leaves without the need to use fertilizers. Both have substantial positive effects on plant health and growth. Foliar feeds are partly for nutrients, partly for disease reduction, a diverse and dense microbiome on and in the plant largely prevents opportunistic infections completely and also boosts secondary metabolite production in plants. Those are the parts that provide most of the nutrients and flavour.

Once the irrigation systems are installed, this would be done via automated irrigation, but until then one employee would have the job of doing so during the growing season using a boomless sprayer behind an ATV, something narrow enough to use the same paths as the public. This would be an ongoing task every growing season.

#### **3.8 Mowing Herbaceous Strips**

The herbaceous strips beside the paths are there for mulch and would be mown for use as mulch on a monthly basis. Some of the mulch would go to the tree row, some to the coppice alley. This would be done with a small tractor with a sickle bar mower to cut the material down and a person to walk behind to spread it where it needs to go, partly next to the tree rows and partly in the coppice alleys since we're growing in both areas. This will be a long term task throughout the growing season up until late summer, letting the plants recover before winter dormancy. This would be a task allocated to 1-2 employees, but largely tying their employee time and labour for the bulk of the growing season. This would be with one tractor driver, one mulch placer, although if the mowing is fast enough, this may be something that a single operator can handle. 

#### **3.9 Pruning Passes**

One of the core concepts from syntropic agroforestry is using support species as mulch, extremely high density and hard thinning and pruning. This would be done on the rows every other year with a tractor and a vertical saw bar followed by a chipper and placed under the tree row as mulch, simply take out 70% or so of the branches starting from the path, leaving a more narrow row at the end. That would be the bulk of the pruning, the big addition of organic matter other than the herbaceous strips. This would be done in the spring, providing a growth pulse with the added airflow and light, providing abundant mulch to build soil. The every other year schedule is intended to allow for fruiting on plants that only fruit on second year wood, while ensuring enough light continues to get through the canopy for the understory to grow.

This would be an annual task on alternating rows, so half gets done each year to help reduce labour.

#### **3.10 Breeding Project**

With both a changing climate and a changing soil, there is a need to selectively breed our plants to the new conditions. High biochar soils with abundant and diverse microbial populations don't really exist outside of the Amazon's Terra Preta soils, so all of our plants should be bred for growth in those types of soils as they develop. Weather extremes are another factor that will continue to change, with performance under those conditions being another selection factor alongside taste and yield rather than rely on larger and more mature trees.

This selection would be done by hand every other year, culling from what's left after a pruning pass based on taste tests and observations throughout the growing season, and planting more plants underneath from seedball. The number of species in a row would be added to each planting pass. This culling pass would be kept to the spring and summer, making sure any growth pulse from the introduced light and airflow doesn't occur just as the plant goes into dormancy.

The workforce allocated to this would be whatever is left over from other tasks, this is the growing season's background task that should be done whenever free time is found by any of the farm operators.

#### **3.11 Biochar Application**

A major component of this design is to use the biochar produced largely on-site to build superior soils with higher nutrient retention, more microbial habitat, diversity and quantity, better water retention while draining better, and overall fertility. This is done every time the mowing takes place, spread by a spreader pulled behind an atv or small tractor. The goal is to spread out the biochar before organizing the mulched material after it is cut so we put the biochar under the mulch, slowly incorporating into the soil. We would be using a relatively finely ground char, something on the range of 1-2 mm so the soil life can help it migrate down faster. This is ideally the only time the biochar would be applied, as changing the albedo (reflectivity) of the soils would melt any snowpack beneath it in winter. As a result, the labour for this would be required from spring to the end of summer just like the mowing.

#### **3.12 Biomass Harvesting**

The biomass harvested for biochar production is from coppicing the alleys, cutting them down to the stump, and from pollarding the emergent layer of our tree rows. In both cases, this would be done during the winter months, since it is better to have woody material for the kilns than leafy material, and less compaction occurs from the tractor usage when the ground is frozen.

For the alleys, a coppice harvester and baler would be used. This deposits the harvested material as long straight bundles of wood all tied up for easy handling. This is a key feature for allowing a kiln operator to manage multiple kilns, the material must be quick to load into a kiln by hand. The bundled wood would be picked up in a trailer to haul to a storage and drying area. Wood needs to be dry enough to burn before it can be processed into biochar. For the rows, we would use an energy-wood shear with accumulator fingers on a telehandler with boom at a height of about 4m, giving us room for the fruit and nut trees beneath.

In both cases this would be done every other year on alternating rows so the canopy doesn't close over while still being relatively efficient on coppice and food production.

#### **3.13 Biochar Production**

The core revenue stream behind the project is biochar produced in flame cap kilns. These kilns are basically large cyclindrical containers that get loaded with woody biomass. The exact size and capacity of the kilns would be based on the largest that can be loaded by hand using baled wood from an adjacent bin and finish in about 5 hours. The financial projections in part 4 are based on a 5 cubic yard kiln. The kilns would be equipped with a quench system that would simply spray water from overhead until the kiln was full, ensuring the biochar is all put out that would trigger at the push of a button so the operator can focus on running kilns. After the quench is done the operator would hit the drain button, draining the quench water into a holding tank to be either reused as quench water or used in irrigation after being diluted, which provides nutrients for the soil life.

The kilns would be lined up in a row so that operators can just walk down a line of kilns, topping up kilns as they burn down until the flames die down and the quench can be started. The kilns would tilt to empty into a trailer to be hauled to a separate processing building. This then gets dried, weighed and crushed, ready to be sold or stored as raw biochar. Ideally at least 2 operators would be assigned to the kilns with another assigned to a loader to reload both the wood bins and on reset, the kiln itself. This operator would be responsible for hauling it away for drying and for dumping it into a hoppper for crushing and hauling it to storage. The reason for this is to make sure at least 2 employees are present when handling giant bonfires in case of emergency while providing them support and doing other tasks so they can focus on the kilns.

Raw biochar can be sold as is, or it can be preconditioned by soaking it in JLF for a few days, otherwise it draws nutrients from the soil for the first year before enhancing crop yields. When precharged with nutrients and microbiology biochar produces a significant boost to plant growth and lasts basically forever in soil, for centuries to millenia as we've seen from the Terra Preta soils. Preconditioned biochar is both more useful in the filed and of higher value, but only for growing applications. If selling as an aggregate, it wouldn't provide any additional benefit from preconditioning and wouldn't need to be. How much would be conditioned would depend on how much could be sold horticulturally.

This is a task that can be done any time after the harvested biomass has sufficiently dried, so would likey be scheduled for whenever labour needs are lowest.

#### **3.14 Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV)**

In order to get credits issued you need to prove that you sequestered the carbon. This is where measurements and testing comes in.

For the soil portion, this would be done with portable soil corers to a depth of 3m, which is about as deep as the human portable equipment can handle. This would need to be done with enough samples to meet whatever standards are found in Vera, or whichever other market is being used for the project. Some countries may have more lucrative markets than the voluntary markets. How many core samples would be required would depend on the protocols and the variability of the land, so a 100 hectare uniform plot would be cheaper to verify than 100 1 hectare blocks in different areas.

For biochar we need to test the biochar itself on a batch basis, so in our case measured for each of our species used in coppicing and pollarding and calculated from that. The emissions also need to be monitored to make sure that combustion is efficient and not releasing a bunch of undesirable chemicals into the air. Flame cap kilns tend to be very clean burning though as long as the material is sufficiently dried and clean. This would allow for things like mill scraps as well, although another way to organize the material would need to be found or created in order to maintain production efficiency, but probably not cost effective for things like general mixed brush from public dumping. The testing isn't cheap, so doing larger batches such as by species is cheaper if there's a small number of species.

In both cases, the testing needs to occur at least annualy and is needed before credits can be issued. Other emissions from the project such as fuel need to be measured as well, we only get paid for net sequestration. For biochar this also means that it needs to be sold for non-destructive uses or applied to the soil as well before credit issuance.

### **4.0 Financials and Company Structure**

Parent company with franchised farms. Farms operate until there is no more land that can be afforded for expansion. The land used in the projects are manged for 20 years, which is the duration that has to be committed to for the project. So when all the farm's land has been fully planted out and sustainably irrigated, more is purchased and added to the project. When land is removed from the project after 20 years, it is given to the people who worked it prorated on wages earned during its 20 year lifecycle. This happens separately for each plot of land added to the project. So when there's no more land to add in the area, the franchise shuts down after the last plot expires.

The budget allocation would be 50% to the employees between wages and bonuses with a limit on the wage gap between farm operator and new hire to 100%, so the farm manager would make no more than twice what the new hires make. This isn't meant to be a pyramid scheme where only the owner gets rich, we want genuine livable wages to attract a workforce big enough to matter. Make carbon farming a legitimately sought after career. For the other half of the budget, before profitability the entire 50% is allocated to local expansion and buildout. The local expansion budget isn't used to pay wages, it is used to pay for MRV, equipment, seeds, loan payments and whatever other non-labour costs occur. Once profitable, this switches to 10% to the parent company for global efforts, 10% to starting new farms either locally or in new regions as the farm manager sees fit, and the remaining 30% of revenues continue to go towards local expansion, including new land purchases if the existing land is fully irrigated sustainably.

It should be noted that since these are international carbon markets, they pay the same in Canada as they do in rural Kenya.

The initial farm in each region is obviously required to have all the equipment to build the farm, but once there is a regional farm, newly spawned farms can borrow that equipment and be boosted by seedballs grown locally. As such, new farms start as satellite farms, which once planted out can purchase ther own equipment and spawn new farms of their own. All farms spawn new farms, each profitable farm has an expansion budget allocated every year. The preferred option would be to promote operators to run new farms so both they and the parent farm can then train more people. Rinse and repeat. Having every farm spawn new farms gives us an exponential growth curve, which is sorely needed right now.

#### **4.1 Financial Projections: Revenue & Costs (100Ha Flagship Hub)**

**Cost Structure Clarifications (additions):**  
• **Certifications & compliance:** **Puro.Earth**, **Verra + CCB**, **CFIA**, **OMRI**.  
• **Recurring MRV:** Soil & biochar lab testing, emissions sampling, and data management.  
• **Public documentation:** Ongoing open‑access documentation and education.

The general structure would be a global parent company, Modern Druid Central, with regional hubs that spawn smaller satellite farms, which in turn eventually upgrade themselves to regional hubs and spawn more satellite farms of their own. Every farm spawns new farms. This is absolutely critical for an exponential growth rate, which we rather need right now to have a chance at scaling fast enough to make a difference. The career workers earn farms of their own, providing a path to generational wealth and local prosperity and local ownership. If there is no more land to add, the final cycle gives the rest of the land to the employees at completion and the project shuts down in that area. So these farms and projects are expected to end as far as the company is concerned, this isn't a new form of colonization, it's a new form of regeneration. We come, use the land to sequester enough carbon to save the world and pass the land back to the local populations more fertile and productive than ever, and provide free healthy food in the interim. We leave prosperity in our wake, not exploited populations.

Anyone who wants to do a project of their own is not competing against us, they're competing with us against the apocalypse.
3.  **Carbon Market Management**
4.  **Regional Hub Installation Service**, both paid and unpaid. Communities and organizations would be able to pay a premium to go to the front of the line, being charged enough to fund the project and the MDC efforts, including additional hubs elsewhere.
5.  **Network Seed Stock Curator**

**The "Hub-in-a-Box" Service: Scaling Planetary Repair**
MDC offers a turnkey service for clients (governments, impact investors, communities) to establish a certified carbon-removal project.
*   **The Client Provides:** Land, local labor, and capital.
*   **MDC Provides:** Project design, launch package (equipment, seeds), certification guidance, and training.
*   **Ownership Structure:** The resulting Project Company is owned by the local stakeholders and operates under the standard Modern Druid constitutional governance.

**MDC's Financial Model & Reinvestment Strategy**
MDC sustains itself through:
1.  **Royalties:** A 10% royalty on net revenue from **profitable** Project Companies.
2.  **Regional Hub Launch Fees:** Fees charged for the "Hub-in-a-Box" service at a **significant premium** to cost, allowing for administrative staff and contributing to new regional launches.

#### **4.5 Key Viability Metrics & Feedback Loops**

**Key Metrics:** Biomass→biochar conversion efficiency; annual biomass yield (t/ha); labour efficiency (ha/person); carbon‑credit pricing (soil + biochar); biochar market development.  

**Feedback Loops:**  
• **Soil–Biomass Positive Feedback:** As soil organic matter rises, biomass yields increase, enabling more biochar production and soil amendments—further boosting fertility and sequestration capacity.  
• **Soil–Biochar Positive Feedback:** Biochar application increases soil carbon sequestration rates long-term. Soil with biochar grows faster.
• **Revenue Amplification:** Higher biomass yields elevate biochar sales and credit earnings, financing expanded planting and infrastructure for the next cycle.

### **7.0 Scaling**

If we can drive wide scale adoption, whether by large scale international investments or simply by market forces of 'compete with free or go out of business', we have the potential to remove carbon dioxide from our atmosphere at multiple parts per million of CO2 per year, potentially per month when soil gains are included and operations expand beyond just farmland. This solves the runaway carbon levels and gives us a path back to a stable climate with CO2 levels at pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm, down from our 425 ppm today. Methane will drop back down on it's own, oxidizing into carbon dioxide over decades and centuries.

But only if we stop the emission of methane. For that we need to refreeze the permafrost. Having more heating from methane than we'd stop by restoring CO2 levels would mean that it's a runaway methane relase that will melt the rest of the permafrost. As in **ALL OF IT**. Dealing with 1.5 to 2 degrees Celcius is bad enough, but if the permafrost starts melting fast enough (and as anyone from a place with winter can attest, things melt FAST once you start getting up to 10-20 degrees above zero), we're looking at potentially 10+ degrees Celcius of warming. The Permian–Triassic mass extinction event took place 252 million years ago when our temperatures rose by 8 degrees over a period of 60,000 years. It was the largest extinction event in Earth's history, deadlier even than when the asteroid killed the dinosaurs. And it occurred because of runaway carbon dioxide and methane levels in our atmosphere. Making that kind of temperature jump over a few hundred years basically ends all life on this planet larger than a cockroach unless it lives in a powered bunker with air conditioning and food production.

How to refreeze it? There's really only one technology we have that can make that kind of a change in time. Solar Radiation Management, or Geo-Engineering. Reflecting enough sunlight back into space to reduce the warming from the sun. Something like marine cloud brightening. This solution can remove the carbon, but we need to buy it time before methane heats us up further than we can cool it. Not that something like large scale marine cloud brightening wouldn't dramatically change weather patterns on its own, but a lot less than 10 degrees of warming will.

#### **7.1 The Vision: Scaling a Planetary Solution**

This hub is a prototype for a new land-use paradigm. Our growth model is exponential: each profitable project allocates 10% of its revenue to an Expansion Fund to seed new farms, led by our own trained employees and another 10% goes towards global expansion efforts and R&D. Each hub would spawn new satellite farms that would initially share equipment and facilities, but would buy or build their own as they mature into hubs themselves before spawning new satellite farms in turn. Every farm spawns new farms. Until there are no new farms left to spawn.

We largely bypass politics and tap into global capital markets to pay for planetary repair. The voluntary carbon market is the initial catalyst; a future governed by a sane carbon price is the ultimate goal. Without a UN-scale carbon market, the scale is limited by voluntary efforts, but if we can show that it can work at scale, that it can both sequester substantial amounts of carbon and still produce comparable or higher food yields, we can help make that happen. Prove that the solution works to get the policy makers to act. At some point the public at large will become much more interested in carbon removal, probably shortly after they start running out of food.

#### **7.2 The Necessary Expansion: Beyond Prime Cropland**

The true potential however lies beyond prime agricultural land.

1.  **Degraded and Marginal Lands:** The protocol is uniquely suited for land rehabilitation. This makes **atmospheric water generation (AWG)** a non-negotiable R&D priority to establish systems anywhere on Earth.
2.  **The Ocean Frontier: Kelp Farming:** Macroalgae is one of the fastest-growing organisms on Earth. Harvested kelp can be converted to biochar, used for biostimulants, or food. This unlocks the largest ecosystem on Earth for CDR.
3.  **Coastal Development:** Using desalination and halophytic (salt-loving) plants to green coastal areas that are otherwise too salinated or too dry for crops.

**The Integrated Planetary Strategy**
The ultimate scale requires a multi-pronged approach:
*   **Degraded Land:** Rehabilitate deserts, eroded fields, & contaminated sites. Adds **billions of hectares** of potential land.
*   **Ocean:** Mass-producing biomass for blue carbon. Unlocks the largest ecosystem. Biomass can be used to jump start degraded sites.
*   **Prime Agricultural Land:** The proven, immediately deployable model.

**Conclusion:** The challenge is to reorganize humanity's relationship with both the land and the sea. By developing tools to restore the world's most damaged ecosystems, we move from offsetting emissions to actively engineering a recovery of the atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic carbon balance.

### **8.0 Investments and Final Thoughts**

#### **8.1 Investment Summary**

If someone with the startup funds likes the idea sufficiently to want to start this, by all means feel free to get in touch with me at robert.mccarthy.ca@member.mensa.org. This is still very much at the 'one dude and an idea' stage, but I'd love to give it a shot if I could.

The investment is partially de-risked by:
*   **Existing Markets:** Revenue is based on high-demand, international carbon removal markets.
*   **Political Resilience:** Immune to most political opposition by catering to international markets.
*   **Phased Revenue:** A clear timeline to profitability.
*   **Value-Add Strategy:** A path to higher margins through retail sales and increased soil fertility.
*   **Scalability:** The hub-and-spoke model allows for exponential growth.
*   **Grants:** The possibility of government level grants and startup loans is another potential source of funding beyond carbon revenues.

Garden like a beast. Have fancy bonfires. Let people pick their own damn food. Dare to solve the problem.
