- Contribution to reversing climate tipping points by 2030+ timeframe

### **SDG 15 ‚Äì Life on Land**
- Restoration of **degraded lands** through perennial polycultures and food forests
- Promotion of **native biodiversity** and wildlife corridors
- Soil regeneration practices prioritizing microbial and fungal diversity

### **SDG 17 ‚Äì Partnerships for the Goals**

## üìà Potential Secondary Contributions

| SDG | Potential Contributions |
|-----|--------------------------|
| 1 ‚Äì No Poverty | If future sites are deployed in marginalized communities, offering food and income security |
| 4 ‚Äì Quality Education | If formal training programs and certifications are developed for carbon farming techniques |
| 10 ‚Äì Reduced Inequality | Promoting income equality between developing and developed regions through pay structure |
| 11 ‚Äì Sustainable Cities and Communities | Integrating peri-urban carbon farms around major cities for food and carbon drawdown |
