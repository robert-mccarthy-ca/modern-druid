## 🔥 Biochar Kiln System – Modern Druid

The heart of the Modern Druid carbon farm is a scalable, loader-accessible **flame cap kiln system** designed for small teams to produce high-quality biochar safely and efficiently.

Kilns are fixed in place, filled by loader, topped up by hand during burns, and quenched via a push-button automated system. Once quenched and drained, the biochar is dumped into a trailer and hauled to a secondary processing site for crushing and storage.

## 🛠 Kiln Design Goals

- **Fixed-position, insulated kilns** with a tilting mechanism for easy unloading
- **Automated quench and drain system** to minimize labour and risk
- **Windbreak-style kiln building**, open-air with forced-air exhaust chimneys
- **No emissions capture required**, but **MRV-compliant emissions monitoring**
- **Safe, year-round operation**, including in snow or rain, with emergency fire suppression
- **Separation of grinding operations** to minimize dust ignition risk

## 🔥 Kiln Function & Workflow

Flame cap kilns are a low-tech, low-emissions method of producing biochar by continuously adding biomass over the flame to reduce oxygen exposure and retain carbon. They're fast, scalable, and simple to build using local materials. Kiln crews would be 2 kiln operators and a loader/driver. This is for safety reasons, if an accident happens with tons of coals, someone needs to be able to operate fire suppression equipment if there's an injury or emergency. The goal is to have a single kiln operator manage 2 or 3 5-yard kilns each and get 2 runs in in a day.

- Kilns are arranged in a line on a **raised platform**
- Biomass is loaded in bulk via loader from below and **topped up by hand** during combustion
- At completion, operators hit a **quench button** to flood the kiln with water
- After cooling and stirring, the water is **drained into a recovery tank** for reuse or soil application
- Once drained, the biochar is **dumped into a trailer** and transferred to a secondary structure for weighing, grinding, drying, and storage

Grinding and packaging are done in a separate building for safety and air quality. Finished biochar may be sold (if certified) or applied directly to the food forest.

## 🧊 Seasonal Workflow & Throughput

To start, the core staff would be working over the winter making biochar, which gets a fairly robust production capacity just from November 1 to April 30. These numbers assume a 12 hour work day, 3 days a week. The difference between an operator who can handle 2 kilns at a time and an operator that can handle 3 is substantial, so improving those efficiencies would make a large difference. Sales would also add to these figures, but assuming enough biomass could be secured, being able to produce 2 kiln runs a day per operator and the operator operating at least 2 kilns themselves witha 3rd operator to reload the kilns and haul away and grind the biochar. The biochar output is enough to pay for additional seasonal food forest employees until that side brings in revenue. Once biochar sales revenue starts, that is in addition to the money we get for the credits.

**Core kiln season**: **November 1 to April 30** (26 weeks)
- **3 days per week**, 2 burns per day
- Leaves **October and May** for other off-season tasks
- **Same 3-person crew** transitions to food forest operations during the growing season

### 📐 Kiln Output – Math Breakdown (5 yd³ Kiln)

Each 5 cubic yard kiln run is calculated as follows:
- 5 yd³ × 0.7646 = **3.823 m³**
- Bulk density of biochar: **250 kg/m³**
- Biochar yield: 3.823 × 250 = **956 kg** = **0.96 tonnes of biochar**
- Biomass required (30% yield): 0.96 ÷ 0.3 = **3.19 tonnes of biomass**
- Carbon content (80%): 0.96 × 0.8 = **0.77 tonnes of carbon**
- CO₂e: 0.77 × 3.67 = **2.81 tonnes CO₂e sequestered per burn**
- Revenue (@ $200 CAD/tCO₂e): 2.81 × 200 = **$562 CAD per burn**

---

### 🔥 Scenario: 3 Operators operating 4 kilns twice daily (1 operating the loader supporting the other 2 operators that operate 2 kilns each)
- Total burns: **624** (26 weeks × 3 days/week × 8 kilns)
- **Biochar produced**: ~**596 tonnes**
- **Biomass processed**: ~**1,988 tonnes**
- **CO₂e sequestered**: ~**1,751 tonnes**
- **Revenue (@ $200 CAD/tCO₂e)**: ~**$350,286 CAD** (26 weeks × 3 days/week × 2 burns/day × 8 kilns)

### 🔥 Scenario: 3 Operators operating 6 kilns twice daily (1 operating the loader supporting the other 2 operators that operate 3 kilns each)
- Total burns: **936** (26 weeks × 3 days/week × 12 kilns)
- **Biochar produced**: ~**894 tonnes**
- **Biomass processed**: ~**2,981 tonnes**
- **CO₂e sequestered**: ~**2,627 tonnes**
- **Revenue (@ $200 CAD/tCO₂e)**: ~**$525,383 CAD**

> ⚠️ **Important**: These biomass volumes (~2,000 to 3,000 tonnes) would require either a **very large site** capable of producing that volume of biomass or reliable **partner relationships** with forestry or agricultural operations with waste streams. This scale is **not expected at startup**, but it is useful for understanding scaling potential.

> The seasonal throughput of a single 3-person crew (8 kilns over 3 days/week during winter) producing over **1,100 tonnes of biochar** is a critical startup capacity baseline.

## 📈 Maximum Year-Round Throughput

For scaling up, two dedicated 3-person kiln crews running **6 days a week year-round** can maximize production capacity of a facility.

### 🔥 Scenario: 3 Operators operating 4 kilns twice daily, 6 days a week, Full-Year
- Total burns: **6 days/week × 8 kilns × 52 weeks = 2,496 burns**
- **Biochar**: ~**2,396 tonnes**
- **Biomass**: ~**7,952 tonnes**
- **CO₂e**: ~**7,003 tonnes**
- **Revenue**: ~**$1.4 million CAD**

### 🔥 Scenario: 3 Operators operating 6 kilns twice daily, 6 days a week, Full-Year
- Total burns: **3,744**
- **Biochar**: ~**3,578 tonnes**
- **Biomass**: ~**11,929 tonnes**
- **CO₂e**: ~**10,504 tonnes**
- **Revenue**: ~**$2.1 million CAD**

These numbers assume consistent feedstock quality, sufficient drying/storage capacity, and uninterrupted operations. At this scale, **on-site biomass generation is unlikely to suffice**, making reliable external partnerships essential and a key part of profitability and how much we can afford for additional summer labour, either to retrieve the biomass or to work in the food forest.

This represents the **maximum scalable throughput** for a single site with 2 full-time kiln crews. Multiple such sites could be coordinated under the same replication model and funding strategy, or a second line of kilns could be placed in the same building if large enough, etc.

## 🧪 MRV Readiness (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)

Puro.Earth requires full traceability and MRV for all credits issued.

### What we measure:
- Input biomass (by weight)
- Output biochar (by dry weight)
- Water used for quenching (reused or soil-applied)
- Emissions (monitored via chimney sensors)

### What we test:
- Carbon content
- Moisture level
- Ash content
- Volatile matter (PAHs)
- Heavy metals

Biochar must be applied to soil or sold for stable use to qualify for credits. Testing is required at least annually for both Puro and CFIA standards and may increase depending on feedstock variability.

## ♻️ Quench Water

- Quench water is reused for later kiln cycles or diluted and applied to the food forest
  - This may require storage if only processing biochar during the winter
- Rich in soluble nutrients and beneficial compounds if managed properly

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Finalize kiln design and dimensions
- Design water recovery and quench system
- Research affordable insulation options such as refractory cement or hempcrete
- Plan biochar transfer and grinding workflow
- Design fume hood structure for emissions monitoring
- Prototype system in cold Canadian climate
