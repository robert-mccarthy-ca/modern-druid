# üß™ Long-Term Projects, Research & Development

This document outlines Modern Druid's strategic long-term projects and R\&D priorities. These initiatives extend beyond the core implementation phase, aiming to continuously improve efficiency, deepen impact, and scale globally.

## üîÑ Process Optimization & Operational Efficiency

### ‚úÖ Kiln Throughput & Carbon Yield Optimization

**Goal:** Improve kiln designs for higher efficiency, faster turnaround, and higher carbon permanence.
**Impact:** Increases credit revenue per labour hour and ensures eligibility for high-value carbon standards.

### ‚úÖ Biochar Distribution Efficiency

**Goal:** Develop workflows for fast, low-labour biochar field application. Determine optimal rates of application.
**Impact:** Critical for scaling across hectares; a key limiter to getting paid for the biochar credits.

### ‚úÖ General Farm Efficiency Improvements

**Goal:** Improve irrigation, mulch automation, field layout, and workload distribution.
**Impact:** Reduces labour requirements, enabling one team to manage more land profitably.

### ‚úÖ Farming Methodology Optimization

**Goal:** Collaborate with agroforestry experts to refine planting patterns, access routes, and successional design.
**Impact:** Boosts yield, ecological performance, and labour scalability over time.

## üåø Plant Breeding & Biomass Selection

### ‚úÖ Breeding Program for Biomass & Soil Carbon Traits

**Goal:** Select seed from all plants, with a focus on vigor and flavour. **Impact:** Builds a line of plants uniquely adapted to terra preta-like soils and the current climate which will be a moving target until we stabilize the planet.

### ‚úÖ Introduce species from adjacent climate zones

**Goal:** Introduce new species from adjacent climate zones as temperatures continue to rise, finding what does best in this new climate.
**Impact:** Ensures we still have a broad selection of species when they start dying off from climate change.

## üîÆ Soil & Climate Science Research

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Rock Weathering Trials

**Goal:** Compare local rock dusts (granite, basalt, etc.) for CO2 capture + soil mineralization.
**Impact:** Adds inorganic carbon removal pathway and an additional revenue stream.

### ‚úÖ Soil Injection Trials

**Goal:** Test vertical application of JMS, IMO, and Johnson-Su to clay-heavy subsoils.
**Impact:** Accelerates root access to deep layers and improves early ecosystem establishment.

### ‚úÖ Saprotrophic Fungi Integration

**Goal:** Introduce wood-decomposing fungi to biomass rows and woody mulch.
**Impact:** Additional biodiversity and food crops.

### ‚úÖ Soil Capacitance & Moisture Mapping

**Goal:** Install low-cost sensor arrays to monitor EC, temperature, and water profile to 3‚ÄØm.
**Impact:** Provides deep analytics to improve farm performance and MRV accuracy.

### ‚úÖ Landscape-Scale Carbon Hydrology Mapping

**Goal:** Study how deep root systems and biomass cycling affect landscape water retention.
**Impact:** Adds real-world data to global modeling for regenerative watershed impact.

### ‚úÖ Human Microbiome Co-Benefit Study

**Goal:** Explore how exposure to IMO-enhanced soils impacts human skin and gut microbiota.
**Impact:** Opens new scientific and marketing narratives linking soil health and human health.

### ‚úÖ Non-arable Land Conversion

**Goal:** Use mulch and biochar to build soil where it does not exist today, areas such as granite bedrock outcroppings.
**Impact:** Increases the available land for these sites.

## üè° Greenhouse Systems & Controlled Environment R\&D

### ‚úÖ Kiln Exhaust to Geothermal Battery

**Goal:** Reuse heat and CO2 from kilns to warm soil for geothermally air in greenhouses over winter.
**Impact:** Increases energy efficiency and supports year-round growing conditions.

### ‚úÖ Biological Aeroponics with Living Soil Cap

**Goal:** Integrate JMS, fermented inputs, and IMO into a hybrid aeroponic system with a 30‚Äì50‚ÄØcm soil bed cap.
**Impact:** Maximizes nutrient cycling and biomass yield in closed-loop systems.

### ‚úÖ Water Harvesting from Steam Exhaust

**Goal:** Capture water from kiln exhaust condensation.
**Impact:** Could reduce water demand in greenhouses and improve circular resource use.

### ‚úÖ Aquaculture/Aquaponics

**Goal:** Produce fish in ponds and/or tanks. Fish waste feeds the soil and plants. Soil and plants filter the waste for the fish to have clean water again.
**Impact:** Improves microbial diversity. Fish becomes another potential food source.

## Aquatic R\&D

### ‚úÖ Halophytic Sites

**Goal:** Use salt tolerant plants to irrigate with seawater on coastal sites.
**Impact:** Can grow without fresh water. Can pave the way for inland farms that require biomass in desert regions.

### ‚úÖ Kelp Farms

**Goal:** Grow biomass in the ocean, not just on land.
**Impact:** Massively expand the plantable area by growing in the ocean. Can provide mulch for soil building on land. Some species are edible.

### ‚úÖ Floating Islands

**Goal:** Create floating islands that support food forests of their own.
**Impact:** Equatorial ocean zones free of hurricanes could be used as agricultural regions as could lakes.

## üé• Education, Documentation & Public Engagement

### ‚úÖ YouTube & Open Documentation

**Goal:** Film, document, and publish all core processes, results, and techniques.
**Impact:** Builds transparency, attracts collaborators, and helps replicate globally.

### ‚úÖ Open-Source Training Materials

**Goal:** Create accessible, step-by-step resources to train new farmers and biochar operators.
**Impact:** Enables high-quality replication across languages, cultures, and climates. Enable anyone to do this.
