🌍 The Modern Druid Project

What would I do if I had the budget to stop climate collapse?

Climate change isn’t coming — it’s here. We’ve already passed 1.5 °C. Permafrost is burning, peat fires from 2023 still smoulder today, and vast carbon stores in the North are being released. Even if we stopped emissions tomorrow (we aren’t — they’re at record highs), hundreds of ppm of CO₂ would still pour into the atmosphere in the coming decades.

Is there a way forward that doesn’t end in collapse?

That’s the challenge. Not offsets or greenwashing. Not another bandaid. The question:
👉 With today’s tools, can we build something that matters at planetary scale and still make a living?
👉 Could we actually remove multiple ppm of CO₂ per year?

This is my attempt to design a solution to this problem.

🌱 The Core Idea

Grow biomass crops on agricultural land using syntropic agroforestry (fast-growing coppice + food forest understory).

Convert woody biomass into biochar (carbonized plant matter), a stable form of carbon that persists in soils for millennia.

Apply biochar back to the soil — improving fertility, water retention, microbial habitat, and yields.

Give away the food. Make it public access. No harvest logistics, no marketing costs, no middlemen. Free, local, organic nutrition that improves food security and lowers living costs.

Make money from carbon. Biochar-based carbon credits (Puro.Earth) + soil carbon credits (Verra CCB) + biochar sales into agriculture, construction, and industry.

This system can sequester ~20 tCO₂e/ha/year with existing methods — more with improved microbial inoculants, irrigation, and breeding. At global scale, that’s multiple ppm of CO₂ drawdown per year.

🍎 The Food Forest Layer

Food forests are some of the most productive food systems we know of. By mixing pollarded biomass trees with edible species across multiple canopy layers, we:

Keep agricultural land food-productive

Speed succession with syntropic agroforestry

Increase biodiversity and resilience

Provide free, local, chemical-free food to surrounding communities

This makes the project viable at scale — because we don’t have to choose between carbon farming and food security.

💰 The Revenue Model

Carbon Credits

Puro.Earth: Biochar carbon removal (~$200 CAD/tCO₂e)

Verra CCB: Soil carbon (lower, but increases with co-benefits)

Biochar Sales

Agriculture, horticulture, filtration, concrete/asphalt replacement, animal bedding/feed, etc.

Community Cobenefits

Free food for locals → higher SDG impact rating → better credit prices

Scaling is international: carbon markets pay the same in Canada as in Kenya. Political inaction doesn’t matter; projects can thrive in any country.

⚒️ The Biochar Process

Ring-of-Fire style kilns, upgraded to insulated, tiltable, quenched units in covered sheds with monitored chimneys.

Throughput:

Each 5-yard kiln run needs ~3.2 t biomass → sequesters ~2.8 tCO₂e

3-person crew running 8 kilns/day → ~22 tCO₂e sequestered daily (2 runs of 4 kilns, 2 kilns each and a floater)

Scale: Meets Puro’s minimum (1,000 t/year) in ~45 kiln days.

Half of the biochar stays on-site (soil improvement + terra preta), half is sold for revenue.

👥 Labour, Governance & Scaling

100 ha managed by 3–5 people under the “no food harvest” model.

Wage model:

50% of earnings go to employees (cap: highest paid earns ≤2× lowest).

Projects run for 20 years, then half of ownership transfers to workers.

Expansion:

Self-replicating model: farms spawn new farms via reinvestment.

Parent company retains a small % for R&D, education, PR, and training.

📊 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The Modern Druid Project could also directly contribute to 14 of the 17 UN SDGs, with the remaining 3 possible as the project matures and expands into kelp farming for the biomass source.

🧭 SDG Coverage (12 of 17)
- SDG 1 – No Poverty → equitable wages + worker ownership.
- SDG 2 – Zero Hunger → free food forests + nutrient-dense food.
- SDG 3 – Good Health & Wellbeing → improved diets, cleaner air/soil, reduced toxins.
- SDG 4 – Quality Education → open-source training, replication, mentorship.
- SDG 5 – Gender Equality → built-in if farms intentionally empower women and non-binary workers (especially in areas with systemic inequality).
- SDG 6 – Clean Water & Sanitation → biochar reduces nutrient runoff, water harvesting improves access.
- SDG 7 – Affordable & Clean Energy → renewable integration, low-energy kilns, waste-heat recovery.
- SDG 8 – Decent Work & Economic Growth → dignified, well-paid green jobs.
- SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure → replicable agroforestry/biochar infrastructure.
- SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities → equity pay model + prioritizing marginalized communities.
- SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities & Communities → food forests as public commons.
- SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption & Production → waste-to-biochar circular economy.
- SDG 13 – Climate Action → carbon drawdown at ppm scale.
- SDG 15 – Life on Land → reforestation, biodiversity, soil regeneration.

The remaining 3 would require further development to hit them all directly.

- SDG 14 – Life Below Water → hit by:
  - Kelp/seaweed farming for biomass + blue carbon sequestration.
  - Eliminating nutrient runoff into rivers/lakes/oceans.
  - Protecting fisheries and water ecosystems through land–water integration.
- SDG 16 – Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions → hit by:
  - Worker-owned governance model → justice + inclusion.
  - Land trust or co-op ownership → prevents exploitation.
  - Open-source global model → transparent and accountable institutions.
  - Prioritizing Indigenous partnerships → strengthens sovereignty and rights.
- SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals → hit by:
  - Open publishing of methodology.
  - Partnerships with local governments, NGOs, Indigenous groups, and climate funds.
  - Linking to carbon markets + global replication networks.

As of this writing, most projects cap at 5–8 SDGs, 17 just isn't a thing in carbon removal projects today. That’s a premium co-benefit story. Imagine the impact of being able to remove carbon at scales that are relevant to restoring our atmosphere to 300 parts per million and hit every single one of the UNs Sustainable Development Goals and still be profitable as a company and as an industry. It would go a long way towards the argument that we as a global society need a UN level carbon price/tax to pay enough people to do this. Which is what we would need in order to scale to ppm per month, the voluntary market just isn't big enough.

📚 Open Documentation Commitment

All documentation — training materials, engineering drawings, operating workflows, certification forms, and compliance guides — will be published openly. The goal is for any group, anywhere, to replicate and launch their own carbon farm project without proprietary barriers.

🚀 Summary

Carbon: Multiple ppm per year potential at scale

Food: Free, local, organic, chemical-free

People: Real wages, long-term ownership transfer

Planet: Soil fertility, biodiversity, resilient hydrology

Policy: Bypasses politics through global markets

This is how we could disrupt industrial agriculture (make them compete with free), restore ecosystems, provide food security, and reverse climate change, with or without political will. All by simply not walking the path that exploits the land for maximum profit.
