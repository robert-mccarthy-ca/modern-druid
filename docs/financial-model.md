# Financial Model – The Modern Druid Project

The Modern Druid Project is a self-sustaining, replicable collective of carbon farms. A Global Parent Company supports subsidiary Project Companies, each operating one 20‑year farm cycle. Revenues flow through clearly defined channels to ensure equitable pay, local reinvestment, and global growth.

## 1. Corporate Structure

### 1.1 Global Parent Company

* Coordinates global expansion, R\&D, education, and training
* Receives 10% of subsidiary revenues once farms reach profitability
* Reinvests in:

  * New regional project launches
  * Shared R\&D and process development
  * Development of training and education materials
* Profit distributions begin only when global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have begun to fall, but would come from the global parent's budget.

### 1.2 Project Companies (Subsidiaries)

* Operate individual carbon farms over 20‑year cycles
* Revenue allocation **before profitability**:

  * 50% → employee wages & bonuses
  * 50% → local farm improvements
* Revenue allocation **after profitability**:

  * 50% → employee wages & bonuses
  * 20% → local farm improvements
  * 20% → funding new project companies, typically promoting from within
  * 10% → Global Parent Company
* Employees promoted to managers of new farms, creating a self-replicating leadership pipeline
* Ownership of the farm transferred to workers at end of project cycle

## 2. Revenue Streams (100 ha Site, 1500 tonnes of Biomass)

| Stream                      | Units                                   | Yield Range         | Price (CAD)        | Revenue Range (CAD/yr)    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Soil Carbon Credits**     | t CO₂e(10-20 / ha / yr)                     | 1000-2 000 t CO₂e  | \$45 / tCO₂e         | \$45 000 – \$90 000         |
| **Biomass Production**      | t biomass / ha / yr (temperate)             | 1500             | —                  | —                         |
| **Biochar Carbon Credits**  | t CO₂e (30% yield)                       | 1320 t CO₂e       | \$200 / tCO₂e        | \$264 000                 |
| **Biochar Sales**           | L biochar (50% sold)                    | 225 tonnes        | varies             | up to  \$1 500 000         |
| **Total Estimated Revenue** |                                         |                  |                    | **\$309 000 – \$1 850 000** |

## 3. Cost Structure

### 3.1 Startup Investments

* Land acquisition and site design
* Baseline MRV system: soil sampling, lab analysis, data platforms
* Biochar facility: kilns, kiln building, automation, safety systems
* Nursery infrastructure: greenhouse, trays, substrates
* Equipment: small-scale tractors, trailers, water pumps, irrigation lines
* Certification & compliance: Puro.Earth, Verra + CCB, CFIA, OMRI registrations

### 3.2 Recurring OPEX

* MRV and lab testing (soil and biochar analyses)
* Biomass collection, seedball production, planting labor, pruning
* Facility maintenance: kilns, irrigation, infrastructure
* Employee compensation: 50% of gross revenue
* Ongoing public documentation and knowledge sharing
* Sustainable water harvesting upgrades

## 4. Profit & Allocation

| **Stage**          | Wages & Bonuses | Local Improvements | Replication Funds | Global R\&D |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Pre‑profitability  | 50%             | 50%                | 0%                | 0%          |
| Post‑profitability | 50%             | 20%                | 20%               | 10%         |

This ensures workers are prioritized, local farms scale sustainably, and Global R\&D is adequately funded only after local stability.

## 5. Strategic Impact & Scaling

* **Profit growth drivers:**

  * Increased biomass yields via breeding, inputs and system growth
  * Enhanced soil carbon as MRV records deepen
  * Biochar market maturation and premium credit pricing
* **Community benefits:** Free public harvest, job creation, equitable wage structures
* **Global replication:** New farms spin off from successful pilot sites, funded by the 20% new farm startup allocation
* **Market displacement:** Regenerative carbon farming outcompetes extractive monocultures through stacked revenue models

> *A regenerative carbon economy where food is free, land is healed, and profit aligns with planetary health.*

### 5.1 Company Growth Dynamics

* **Exponential Global Expansion:** Each subsidiary farm, upon reaching operational stability, promotes a manager to launch a new project company. With each farm spawning successors, the Global Parent Company follows an O(eˣ) growth curve, scaling exponentially to accelerate carbon removal. Farms would continue starting new farms as the supported ones reach profitability and can sustain themselves. Individual farms would pick their own farm locations to start, but the global company would start them based on global strategies. Potential expansion limited to anything that can be irrigated today, the farms will build their own sustainable irrigation as they mature, but initially it will require an existing water source.

### 5.2 Project-Level Feedback Loops

* **Soil–Biomass Positive Feedback:** Enhanced soil organic matter increases tree and understory productivity, yielding larger harvests. Increased biomass drives greater biochar production and soil amendments, further boosting fertility and sequestration capacity.
* **Revenue Amplification:** Higher biomass yields elevate biochar sales and carbon credit earnings, financing expanded planting and infrastructure, fueling a virtuous cycle of ecological and financial growth.

## 6. Key Viability Metrics

* **Biomass‑to‑Biochar Conversion:** Yield efficiencies & kiln throughput
* **Annual Biomass Yield:** t biomass / ha
* **Labour Efficiency:** ha managed / person
* **Credit Pricing:** Market rate for soil and biochar credits
* **Biochar Market Development:** Adoption rates and sales channels

Continual monitoring of these KPIs informs adaptive management, ensuring The Modern Druid Project remains profitable and ecosystem‑positive.
