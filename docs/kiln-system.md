# 🔥 Biochar Kiln System – Modern Druid

The heart of the Modern Druid carbon farm is a scalable, loader-accessible **flame cap kiln system** designed for small teams to produce high-quality biochar safely and efficiently.

Kilns are fixed in place, filled by loader, topped up by hand during burns, and quenched via a push-button automated system. Once quenched and drained, the biochar is dumped into a trailer and hauled to a secondary processing site for crushing and storage.

## 🛠 Kiln Design Goals

- **Fixed-position, insulated kilns** with a tilting mechanism for easy unloading
- **Automated quench and drain system** to minimize labour and risk
- **Windbreak-style kiln building**, open-air with forced-air exhaust chimneys
- **MRV-compliant emissions monitoring**
- **Safe, year-round operation**, including in snow or rain, with emergency fire suppression
- **Separation of grinding operations** to minimize dust ignition risk

## 🔥 Kiln Function & Workflow

Flame cap kilns are a low-tech, low-emissions method of producing biochar by continuously adding biomass over the flame to reduce oxygen exposure and retain carbon. They're fast, scalable, and simple to build using local materials.

To streamline operations:
- Kilns are arranged in a line on a **raised insulated platform**
- Biomass is loaded in bulk via loader from below and **topped up by hand** from adjacent bins during combustion
- At completion, operators hit a **quench button** to flood the kiln with water
- After cooling and stirring, the water is **drained into a recovery tank** for reuse or soil application
- Once drained, the biochar is **dumped into a trailer** and transferred to a secondary structure for grinding, drying, and storage

Grinding and packaging are done in a separate building for safety and air quality. Finished biochar may be sold (if certified) or applied directly to the food forest.

## 🧊 Winter Considerations

- Biochar cannot be applied on snow-covered land without increasing albedo and melting snowpack — it must be **stockpiled over winter**
- All production during winter is stored for later application or packaging
- Application or sale is **required** before carbon credits can be claimed (biochar must be in a stable end-use, not stockpiled indefinitely)
- If production throughput is high enough, biochar could be produced over the winter months and applied in the spring/summer to spread the work throughout the year.

## 🧱 Kiln Building Design

- Constructed from metal with **cut-out lower walls** for passive air intake
- Equipped with **forced-air chimney fans** to extract emissions
- Entire structure functions as a **giant fume hood**, allowing for emissions monitoring and MRV compliance
- Allows for year-round operation in variable conditions
- Emergency fire suppression systems included
- Dust-generating operations (grinding, packaging) take place in a separate building for safety

## 🌲 Biomass Sourcing & Flow

- **Primary goal**: generate all biomass onsite via agroforestry
- **Early stages**: use local forestry waste streams to meet Puro.Earth’s 1000 tCO₂e minimum and generate additional revenue
  - Ideal partnerships: logging/milling operations with slash piles or waste they pay to dispose of
  - May require manual collection (chainsaws, trailers)
- **Non-kiln-suitable fines** (sawdust, small chips): diverted to food forest as mulch
- **Moisture control**: all biomass must be dry before use; storage infrastructure needed

---

## 📦 Biochar Handling & Sales Strategy

- Biochar is **weighed and tested** before sale or application
- Only biochar that is **sold for use in soil or applied to the farm** counts for crediting — not fuel or untracked uses
- Once **CFIA registration** and **OMRI certification** are complete:
  - Biochar is sold online only (no physical storefront)
  - Packaged in 1-cubic-foot bags
  - Orders are fulfilled as received; unsold stock is applied to the farm
- Goal is to **keep production continuous** as long as biomass is available

## 🧪 MRV Readiness (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)

Puro.Earth requires full traceability and MRV for all credits issued.

### What we measure:

- Input biomass (by weight)
- Output biochar (by dry weight)
- Water used for quenching (reused or soil-applied)
- Emissions (monitored via chimney sensors)

### What we test:

- Carbon content
- Moisture level
- Ash content
- Volatile matter (PAHs)
- Heavy metals (especially with urban or mixed waste streams)

> Biochar **must be applied to soil or sold for stable use** to qualify for credits. Testing is required at least annually and may be triggered by feedstock changes.

## ♻️ Quench Water

- Water from quenching is **reused** for later quench cycles or applied to the food forest (after dilution)
- It acts as a nutrient-rich soil drench if managed properly

---

## 📈 Credit Eligibility and Thresholds

- Puro.Earth minimum: **1000 tCO₂e per year**
- With 10 t/acre biomass yield and ~3.25 tCO₂e per acre sequestered, this requires ~300 acres OR access to local waste biomass streams
- Emissions from collection and transport are subtracted from credit value — local sourcing is critical for net removal

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Finalize kiln design and dimensions
- Design water recovery and quench system
- Research affordable insulation options
- Plan biochar transfer and grinding workflow
- Design fume hood structure for emissions monitoring
- Prototype system in cold Canadian climate
