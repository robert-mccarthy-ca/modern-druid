## üéØ SDG Contributions

### **SDG 1 ‚Äì No Poverty**
- Farms continue to spawn new farms until the community is fully employed or runs out of land
- Developed nation level wages
- Additional entrepeneurial opportunities for the locals with excess food (value added products or simply export sales)
- The employees, not the owners receive the bulk of the earnings

### **SDG 2 ‚Äì Zero Hunger**
- Establishment of **free food forests** for local communities
- Year-round food production via syntropic agroforestry methods
- Promotes food security and local food sovereignty

### **SDG 3 ‚Äì Good Health and Well-being**
- Restoration of **microbially diverse soils** producing nutritionally dense foods
- No synthetic pesticide, fungicide, or herbicide use
- Free public access to clean, nutrient-rich food sources
- Food contains all the microbial diversity that our diets are supposed to have, helping reduce cases of dysbiosis

### **SDG 8 ‚Äì Decent Work and Economic Growth**
- **50% of all revenue** directed to employee wages and bonuses
- Creation of dignified, regenerative agriculture jobs in rural areas
- Equitable pay structure across global deployment (same pay in developing and developed nations)

### **SDG 10 ‚Äì Reduced Inequality**
- Same wages anywhere in the world
- International markets pay the same everywhere

### **SDG 11 ‚Äì Sustainable Cities and Communities**
- Food source is now local and carbon negative
- Sustainable irrigation means they **stay sustainable** even through droughts, groundwater depletion, or lakes and rivers drying up

### **SDG 12 ‚Äì Responsible Consumption and Production**
- Conversion of **local organic waste streams** into biochar and mulch
- Promotion of **zero-waste farming systems**
- Emphasis on **natural farming inputs** and ecosystem services

### **SDG 13 ‚Äì Climate Action**
- Verified removal of atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ through **soil carbon sequestration** and **biochar application**
- Open-source replication model to enable global scaling
- Contribution to reversing atmospheric carbon dioxide

### **SDG 15 ‚Äì Life on Land**
- Restoration of **degraded lands** through perennial polycultures and food forests
- Promotion of **native biodiversity** and wildlife corridors
- Soil regeneration practices prioritizing microbial and fungal diversity
- Act as a living seed bank for the surrounding areas

# ‚úÖ Summary

Modern Druid is designed to be a **multi-SDG aligned regenerative project** ‚Äî actively addressing food security, climate resilience, rural economic development, biodiversity recovery, and atmospheric carbon removal in one scalable framework. This is designed to bring carbon farming to life as a profitable career choice so we can encourage enough people to do this so we can stop our runaway CO2 levels.

**Farm carbon. Feed people. Fix the planet.**
