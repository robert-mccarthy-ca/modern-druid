# ðŸ”¥ Biochar Kiln System â€“ Modern Druid

The heart of the Modern Druid carbon farm is a scalable, loader-accessible **Ring of Fire-style kiln system**, designed for small teams to produce high-quality biochar safely and efficiently. Lines of these kilns would be filled by loader and topped up throughout the burn by hand by human operators until quench, which would be automated to just a button, as would drain, and then the biochar could be dumped to a trailer and reloaded by loader.

## ðŸ›  Kiln Design Goals

- **Fixed position, insulated kilns** with tilting mechanism for easy unloading, insulated for faster runs
- **Automated quench system** that reuses water, protects the crew, and reduces labour
- **Windbreak structure to operate kilns in**, open to the elements but safe for year-round use
- **No emissions capture**, but emissions will be **monitored** for MRV

## ðŸ§ª MRV Readiness

- All kiln runs will be weighed and logged
  - Biomass that went in
  - Unprocessed biomass that came out
  - Biochar that came out after it dries
- Quench water volumes will be recorded and recaptured for reuse or soil application
- Output biochar will be tested for:
  - Carbon content
  - Moisture
  - Ash and volatile matter
  - Contaminants (heavy metals, etc.)

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

- Sketch out initial kiln dimensions and layout
- Define quench tank system and drainage
- Research cost-effective insulation for walls
- Decide on optimal biochar handling (loader, auger, or conveyor), processing (grinding or milling) and storage
- Test prototype workflows in cold Canadian climate
