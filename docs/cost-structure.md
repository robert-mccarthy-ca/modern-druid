# üõ†Ô∏è Cost Structure ‚Äì Modern Druid

Modern Druid's cost structure is designed to prioritize essential systems first (land access, carbon credit eligibility, farm establishment), while minimizing unnecessary overhead to maximize early profitability and scalability.

## üìã Core Startup Costs

### 1. **Land Acquisition**
- **Purchase** cost of farmland (costs vary widely by region)
- Target: 100-200 hectares for initial test site, smaller expansions should be possible after minimum Puro requirements are met

### 2. **Baseline MRV and Soil Testing**
- Initial full-depth (0‚Äì3m) soil core sampling and third-party lab testing
- GPS mapping and database setup for MRV

### 3. **Biochar Facility Setup**
- Kiln construction (Ring of Fire kilns or modular systems)
- Insulation, quench water systems, scales, conveyors (as capacity increases)
- Crusher/grinder equipment for post-processing biochar
- Minimal initial emissions monitoring equipment (for Puro compliance)
- Kiln building

### 4. **Nursery Setup**
- Greenhouse materials or shade structures
- Pots, trays, soil substrates for seedling propagation and seedballs
- Irrigation for nursery area

### 5. **Essential Equipment**
- Small tractor or loader
- Trailers for biomass and biochar transport
- Vehicles for hauling trailers and biomass
- Soil augers or hydraulic corers (for MRV sampling)
- Water tanks and pumps

### 6. **Regulatory and Certification Fees**
- Verra + CCB project registration and validation
- Puro.Earth project registration and validation
- CFIA/OMRI biochar product certification
- Legal and consulting costs for project documentation

## üìã Ongoing Operational Costs

### 1. **Lab Testing and MRV**
- Annual soil sampling and lab tests
- Annual biochar batch testing (carbon content, contaminants)
- Emissions monitoring (where applicable)

### 2. **Labour**
- Crew wages
- 50% of revenue allocated to wages under Modern Druid revenue-sharing model

### 3. **Biomass Management**
- Collection, drying, and processing of biomass for kilns
- Seed purchase for seedball production and replanting

### 4. **Infrastructure Maintenance**
- Kiln maintenance
- Pond maintenance and atmospheric water harvesting system upkeep
- Solar and wind generation maintenance
- Irrigation
- Water harvesting

### 5. **Knowledge Documentation**
- Media production (video, blog, website hosting)
- Open-source publishing of results

## üìà Prioritization Strategy

- **Phase 1**: Secure land, complete MRV baseline, build first kilns, build kiln building, build nursery, microbial surveys and inoculations, start planting the first phase of the food forest.
- **Phase 2**: Expand kiln capacity, automate biochar handling, install irrigation and water harvesting.
- **Phase 3**: Optimize farm operations, initiate drone and AR integration, publish full replication kits, continue adding sustainable irrigation, start new farms.

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

Modern Druid‚Äôs cost structure is designed to ensure:
- Early eligibility for carbon credit revenue
- Minimal critical infrastructure to launch operations
- Scalable growth through reinvestment and modular expansion

This lean startup model supports a self-replicating, regenerative farm system capable of scaling globally with resilience and minimal capital barriers.
