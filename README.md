# 🌿 The Modern Druid Project

**Introducing carbon farming as a profession for a livable planet.**

The Modern Druid Project is my attempt to design (and hopefully one day get to build) a globally scalable, revenue-generating carbon farming model based on voluntary carbon markets — one that sequesters meaningful levels of atmospheric carbon, raises the fertility of the land, provides free food and good wages to the communities they're based in. The idea is to run 20 year projects where we buy the land, build a community food forest using natural farming and syntropic agroforestry principles where we grow food alongside biomass for biochar in the growing season, convert it to biochar over the winter in large batch kilns, earning our revenue from carbon and carbon alone. True carbon farming, no greenwashing, the people can come see, feel and even taste the carbon we've sequestered. Carbon removal credits through Puro.Earth, carbon removal credits through Vera, and biochar sales specifically. Oh, and once profitable, the farms finance and start new farms themselves, who will in turn spawn new farms and so forth. Exponential growth built in. A self multiplying carbon farming system.

In pursuit of local food security and economic resilience, the food is free to the public and always will be. There will be no use of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides or chemical fertilizers of any kind, just clean healthy food ... for free. Excess food can either be left to feed the soil or harvested by locals that want to export the produce or process it into a value added project and sell that. As long as the locals still have enough to eat, these entrepeneurs have our blessing. Financial benefits to the community extend beyond just dropping the cost of food, they can now start businesses of their own using our excess if they want too.

Ecological sustainability is not the only sustainability effort we will be undertaking though, we plan to make carbon farming a legitimate, attractive, financially sustainable career choice. To do this, we plan to pay our employees equitably with 50% of revenue going to employee wages and bonuses. We would also cap the wage gap between new hire and farm manager to a factor of 2 based on hourly pay including bonuses, because morale is higher when everyone is making good money, not just a few. We need motivated and innovative employees to make this work, so keeping them paid equitably and directily incentivized to come up with better ways is key. And since earnings are based on international markets, they pay the same in developed parts of the world as they do in poorer nations. Once teh project is complete, the land stays in the community, going to the farmers who worked and built those projects.

Ideally this would eventually be a using UN regulated carbon removal market system, but that doesn't exist today. The closest we have are **national regulated carbon markets** which are subject to the whims of politics but have more stable prices and **international voluntary carbon markets**, which are politically resilient but susceptible to market forces. We plan to target the voluntary carbon markets for now, which means that this model would produce the same wages and earnings in Canada as in Peru or Kenya. Globally reproducible. It also has the potential to meet 11 of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, so we would be aiming at Vera + CCB for our soil carbon credits. And simply by not going for all the profits, by not being too greedy, we can give the food away for free and put the first nail in the coffin of the biocide based destructive agriculture industry that is destroying the world's soils. Let them compete with fresh, local, organic and free.

To accomplish all of this, we would combine **biochar production**, **syntropic agroforestry**, **natural farming**, and **sustainable water harvesting for irrigation** to build climate resilience, enrich soil, and create a blueprint for distributed, regenerative carbon removal. Biochar is produced in large low tech flame cap kilns from biomass either grown for purpose or diverted from other waste streams. Each farm is designed to continously **spawn new farms** as part of its operating budget, creating an exponential growth curve to fuel enough expansion to make a meaningful global impact. Whatever biochar that is not sold is applied to the food forest, improving microbial habitat, water retention and nutrient retention. The microbial life of our soils need to be actively enhanced, both in quantity and diversity, something that natural farming excels at, and it needs to be done continuously as our soils develop allowing new species to thrive. Syntropic agroforestry excels at growing biomass and growing soil through ongoing ultra dense and diverse successional plantings, canopy management and heavy pruning cycles. Irrigation will need to be applied and continuously upgraded to sustainably harvest and store water through **atmospheric water harvesting** or **desalination** depending on the area and **pond storage**. We’ve crossed too many climate tipping points to count on historical rainfall patterns anymore. This can be boostrapped anywhere with water today, but until irrigation is installed and sustainably secured, it will be fragile in the face of the several degrees of warming we appear to be headed for. Without water, forests burn, food forests included.

## 📈 Scalable Carbon Removal

Syntropic agroforestry systems can reliably produce **10 tonnes of dry biomass per acre per year** in temperate climates, and up to **20–30 tonnes** in tropical zones or more as they mature, especially when watered.

Using a conservative estimate (10 tonnes/acre), we can sequester about **3.25 tonnes of CO₂ per acre per year** by converting the biomass into high-carbon biochar. To offset just **1 ppm of atmospheric CO₂** (7.81 Gt), it would take **~887 million acres** — or about **10% of global farmland**. With global replication, this model could remove **multiple ppm of CO₂ per year**, while providing food security, ecological regeneration, and meaningful jobs in every region of the world. And that’s just the biochar. That doesn’t even count the **soil carbon** captured by perennial food forests. Improving soil quality and as the food forests get larger, these impacts should continue to increase year after year. Together, atmospheric CO2 removal at the rate of ppm per month is potentially possible while also feeding the world and providing meaningful employment and local wages worldwide.

This would require international regulatory carbon markets with a minimum price to scale to that size, but to get there, we need to show that carbon markets can work at meaningful levels. Using the voluntary carbon markets, this project will attempt to demonstrate that a price on carbon can indeed draw down carbon in a substantial way and can be used to end the land management practices that are destroying the soil carbon reserves globally.

No greenwashing. Real carbon drawdown that people can see, touch and even taste themselves.

## ⚡ Why Free Food?

We give the food away. All of it. What people don't eat can be exported or processed by enterprising locals. Not because there isn’t profit in food — but because **there’s more carbon we can draw down** if we don’t waste time on harvest logistics, sales, and transport. Growing food and biomass is a whole lot easier if you don't have to plan for harvesting the food or care much what the yield is, if you can design your workflows for raw production you can grow a lot with just a few people. Let the public pick their own damn food, we're busy sequestering carbon. To **crush extractive, degenerative, toxin-based, ecologically destructive industrial agriculture** with simple market forces: our food is free ... compete with that. Without profits being available to compete for, the business model of forcing people to pay for the privilege of eating simply ceases to exist. It’s not just a farm — it’s a tool for **ending extractive agriculture** and replacing it with something that feeds everyone and heals everything.

If we can prove this model works, carbon markets will reward it, farmers will go out of business and we will replace them. No one will be able to justify spraying poisons on monocrops ever again and calling it food. Our food should be carbon negative, not a major source of pollution from shipping.

## 🌿 Why Bother?

Because I like forests. Because I like food. Because I live here. Because neither the forests nor our food supply will exist here or anywhere else in 20 years unless someone builds a way to stop runaway carbon dioxide levels. Because you shouldn't have to pay for the privilege of eating. Because profitable business doesn't have to be exploitatively predatory. Because the world is being burned down by industrial agriculturalists and they need to be stopped. Because humans don't survive several degrees of warming without decentralized and stable food production. Because a career based on scaled up gardening and bonfires with earnings tied to the price of carbon in a burning world sounds like something I would like to do.

## 🚀 2030 Project Goals

- **Profitability** from verified carbon removal credits and biochar sales
- **Replicable and deployed** to at least one new site
- **Full transparency** and open access to all workflows, designs, project application forms, and verification methods that people would need to start their own
- **Non-exploitative revenue sharing**: 50% of all farm revenue goes to employees, equally across borders, but each farm is separate so every farm worker has a very direct incentive to make their site succeed
- **Community-first food systems**: All food is free to the public, always, no exceptions, we regenerate everything, from the soil and water table, to plants, insects and animals, to the people who rely on them.
- **Global readiness**: All training materials are online, pre-recorded, and free to use

## ⏳ Why 2030?

I’ve picked **2030** as my target deadline because that’s about when I expect we hit the next wall:
- **2°C warming**
- **A Blue Ocean Arctic event**
- **Mass-casualty heat waves**
- **Major food shortages**

Maybe all the above.

That might finally be the moment the world wakes up to the urgency required to reverse climate change — and when it does, it’s going to need a fully documented, globally ready carbon farming system to deploy **immediately**.

**All training materials will be digital and freely available.** The same training materials we would use ourselves would be available to anyone who wants to do this (probably on YouTube). They aren't competing *against* us — they're competing *with* us. We're all racing against ecological collapse and our own extinction.

## 🔧 System Overview

Use natural farming to enhance the soil microbial diversity and provide foliar feeding without chemical fertilizers. Use syntropic agroforestry to grow the food forest and improve the soil through dense and diverse successional management. Use the woody biomass to produce biochar and leave the rest for the soil, apply biochar to the soil, improving microbial habitat as well as water and nutrient retention. Follow all that up with irrigation to offset the wild swings in weather we can expect since we as a global society have failed to stop runaway carbon emissions. This ensures that our food forest continues to reliably grow even if droughts or heat waves occur. Existing water sources would be used to start, but upgrading throughout the project's life cycle to use atmospheric water harvesting and stop using surface water would be a major priority. Ideally we would be adding to the water table instead of drawing from it. And when the soil improves, so does the rest of the yields, specifically our food and biomass production, our carbon sequestration rates, which in turn increase soil growth rates. A nice happy little feedback loop. 

The company revenue would be generated by carbon removal credits and biochar sales. Puro.Earth carbon credits are for the biochar portion because durable carbon is worth more than living carbon. Vera + CCB would likely be the preferred choice for soil carbon credits as they focus on projects with co-benefits and a higher price for them, and we have a lot of co-benefits. The credits would probably be sold on the respective market places, but direct to companies is an option as well. Biochar sales are permitted in addition to the carbon credits as long as it is going to a permanently sequestered purpose, so soil amendment, aggregate, livestock food additive and so forth would be allowed, but not for burning or anything else that releases the carbon back to the atmosphere. Sales would simply be online from the website, so we would simply package the orders and ship, keeping labour to a minimum.

### 🔥 Biochar Production
- Purpose grown biomass converted to biochar in insulated, tiltable kilns
- Local forestry waste converted to biochar
- Quench water recovered for irrigation
- Biochar verified for carbon markets (Puro.Earth) and approved for commercial sale (CFIA, OMRI)
- 50%+ of the purpose grown biochar added to the soil of the food forest, continuously building a modern analog of terra preta

### 🌳 Syntropic Agroforestry
- Successional food forest system with high biomass crops, nitrogen fixers, pollinators, and edible trees
- Designed with wild buffers, biodiversity, and resilient water infrastructure in mind
- Unsold biochar is applied to the soil, no waste
- More efficient methods can be used to grow food when you don't have to worry about harvesting or selling the product, the only harvesting is biomass during pruning cycles.

### 🧪 Natural Farming
- KNF and JADAM practices: JMS, IMO collections, FPJ, LAB, and more
- Continuous microbial input supports soil health and biodiversity as it progresses through its successional phases

## 💸 Revenue Model

Revenue comes from:
- **Puro.Earth** biochar carbon removal credits
- **Verra VCS + CCB** soil carbon removal credits
- **Biochar sales**

The first revenue stream to come online would be Puro credits, which alone should be enough to keep things afloat if barely. The soil carbon and biochar sales would make the difference between a basic living and a comfortable one. Soil samples would be annually to minimize seasonal variances and would be the next to come online. These will be less revenue than the biochar credits, but should provide the necessary buffer to allow for more growth and provide more comfortable wages. The biochar sales has the highest earnings potential, but at least here in Canada, the registration process takes more than a year. That would likely be different based on where the project farm is. At least half of the biomass grown and converted to biochar would be used to continue growing the soil, but the rest and any made from industrial waste streams could be sold, which could bring in substantial profits, more than the other two combined if it could be marketed properly.

The primary risk factor on earnings prices is market demand, but as we haven't even slowed down our emissions yet, that's unlikely to be a short or even a long term threat on the carbon markets. If anything we would expect the voluntary price of carbon to have an upward trend. For biochar sales, there's still substantial variability as it is still a nascent industry for the most part. A really successful food forest could be a good source of marketing though.

> Food is always free. Excess goes to local businesses, processors and entrepeneurs.
> “Pick your own damn food, we’re busy drawing down carbon.”

## 💰 Revenue Allocation

Each site runs on a **20-year cycle**, with revenue split as follows:

### Before Profitability
- **50% to employees** with a basic minimum income until profitable, but directly related to site performance
- **50% to the local site** for infrastructure establishment, debt payments, and all other non-labour costs involved in becoming profitable and sustainable

### After Profitability
- **50% to employees**
- **20% to the local site** - ongoing non-labour expenses, site improvements and other assorted costs
- **10% to the global company** - goes towards research and development, publicly accessible education, remote expansion to new regions, all other non-site specific projects and costs, and any profit taking (after the climate stabilizes and CO2 levels start dropping)
- **20% to starting new farms** — every farm continuously funds new farms as a standard core practice, it's the only way to get an exponential growth curve, and we need that right now

At the end of the 20 years:
- The farm is handed over to the farmers who ran it based on their level of contribution. This gives farms to all of the staff, not just the farm manager, leaving generational wealth in our wake for our employees. Our long term employees can actually retire.
- The company would leave behind fertile food forests with local ownership in its wake

This should be a model welcomed into nearly every community on Earth as a result of all the benefits. Profits don't require predatory levels of exploitation. If this can be viable in Canada, which I believe it can be, this can be brought anywhere with farmland today. The initial size of farm needs to be something on the order of 100-200 hectares to reliably hit the Puro minimum project production levels, but after that, smaller expansions should be possible. The aim being to have 5-10 people per farm, with employees having the opportunity to run their own farms as the farm spawns new farms. There should be a constant churn of new farm manager trainees since expansion is core to the model. The people that make the money are the people who help remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Carbon Farming can be a career, it can be a sexy career in fact. Farming without sales. Gardening at scale when things are growing, having fancy bonfires and other tasks over the winter months, year round work. And we need it to be a desirable and profitable career in order to get enough people interested in doing so in order to succeed at stopping and reversing our rising CO2 levels. This should be replicable until there's no more farmland or no more people to do the farming. Let's start with getting that to be our biggest problem.
