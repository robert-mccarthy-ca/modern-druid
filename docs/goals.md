# üåç Modern Druid Project Goals

## üåø Core Impact Goals

### üå± 1. Draw Down Atmospheric Carbon

* Sequester meaningful quantities of both durable and living carbon using biochar, syntropic agroforestry, and microbial soil restoration.
* Develop a globally scalable and verifiable system capable of influencing global carbon policy (e.g., a UN-backed carbon tax).

### ü•ï 2. Provide Free, Nutrient-Dense Food and Medicine

* Design food forests for community access to perennial crops.
* Prioritize Indigenous and marginalized communities for food and medicinal plant access.

### ‚öñÔ∏è 3. Ensure Equitable Revenue Distribution

* Allocate 50% of all revenue (not just profit) to employees as wages and bonuses.
* Cap income inequality by ensuring no farm worker earns less than half the farm's highest-paid employee.

### üí∏ 4. Create Local Economic Resilience

* Generate regenerative, land-based employment.
* Transition land ownership to workers at project completion (20 years).

### üåæ 5. Restore and Protect Ecological Health

* Regenerate degraded soils through syntropic agroforestry, natural farming and atmospheric water harvesting whether it rains or not, whether there's ground water or not.
* Enhance biodiversity, mycorrhizal networks, and long-term soil structure.

### üî• 6. Prevent and Respond to Wildfire

* Integrate pond storage, sprinklers, and fire-resistant design.
* Assume surrounding forests may burn; build for resilience.

### üìä 7. Generate High-Integrity Carbon Removal Credits

* Prioritize durable carbon via biochar for maximum credit value.
* Certify through Puro.Earth and VCS + CCB standards.

### üîÆ 8. Conduct Long-Term Regenerative R\&D

* Study soil, fungi, root biology, hydrology, and greenhouse energy reuse.
* Optimize and validate systems through continuous experimentation.

### üöó 9. Displace Destructive Agriculture by Market Forces

* Offer free, organic food and high wages to challenge extractive farming.
* Force conventional systems to evolve (or go bankrupt) through competition, no need to rely on the presence of responsible government policies any more.
