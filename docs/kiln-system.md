## üî• Biochar Kiln System ‚Äì Modern Druid

The heart of the Modern Druid carbon farm is a simple line of **flame cap kiln systems** designed for small teams to produce high-quality biochar safely and efficiently. Flame cap kilns are low tech, and can be constructed anywhere in the world from local materials. The only technical part is the emissions monitoring and safe construction of a kiln building, which would require engineering expertise for the prototype, with the designs being made freely available. The rest is basically large fancy bonfires that get put out with water when the flames stop.

Kilns are fixed in place, filled by loader, topped up by hand during burns, and automate the quench which would spray water on the biochar until the kiln is full before draining it into a quench tank. The biochar is then dumped into a trailer and hauled to a secondary processing site for drying, weighing, crushing and storage. The kilns are then reset for the next run.

The complicated part is the logistics. We can avoid most of this simply by growing our own biomass and being our own customer by just applying it to the land instead of selling it. Any sales would be online, simply pack and ship and add to the revenues.

## üõ† Kiln Design Goals

- **Fixed-position, insulated kilns** with a tilting mechanism for easy unloading and reset, maximizing up time
- **Automated quench and drain system** to minimize labour and risk (steam is hot, quenching by hose takes a long time)
- **Windbreak-style kiln building**, open-air with forced-air exhaust chimneys to make the entire building a fume hood
- **No emissions capture required**, but **MRV-compliant emissions monitoring** would be used
- **Safe all weather operation**, including in snow or rain, with emergency fire suppression just in case
- **Separation of grinding operations** to minimize dust ignition risk, done in a separate building

## üî• Kiln Function & Workflow

Flame cap kilns are a low-tech method of producing biochar by burning off the oxygen before it reaches the fuel, with the flame consuming the oxygen first, and with no other path for oxygen to reach the fuel, we achieve combustion without oxygen, or pyrolysis. It stays as char instead of being consumed as ash. They're fast, scalable, and simple to build using local materials. Kiln crews would be 2 kiln operators and a loader/driver. This is for safety reasons, if an accident happens with tons of burning coals, someone needs to be able to operate fire suppression equipment if there's an injury or emergency. The goal is to have a single kiln operator manage 3 or more 5-yard kilns each and get 2 runs in in a day. 5 yards was chosen as an arbitrary size that could be managed by hand, this could be adjusted during prototyping to determine optimal kiln sizes. Ring of Fire kilns are the design inspiration (keep up the good work Kelpie!), but a sturdier, insulated, permanently mounted version on a tiltable platform where you could tip out the kiln onto a trailer. The design would need to be sturdy enough to be loaded by loader on a daily basis and would need drainage to a quench water tank and a quench system that would simply fill the kiln with water when triggered. The quench system being automated means the operators don't need to get scalded with steam and can go back to maintaining the fires in the remaining kilns. All of this would take place in a kiln building which would have its lower side walls cut out, so the entire building becomes a fume hood. The chimneys would be actively exhausted as well, with emissions monitoring equipment in each chimney for Puro MRV compliance. Having the sides open also operates as a passive safety feature where dangerous levels of carbon monoxide or dioxide physically cannot build up as the tops and the bottom are both open, even in the event of total equipment and power failure. They would either go up, drawing in fresh air if lighter than surrounding air, or would flow out the bottom drawing in fresh air from above if heavier.

The setup would be to line up a row of kilns and a row of bins big enough to hold the fuel each run will take to keep it topped off. The workflow would be to fill them using a loader, start the fires, keeping the fuel maintained with biomass from the adjacent bin by hand until complete. At that point it is quenched, drained, and dumped into a trailer before resetting for the next run. The biochar would be taken to a separate building for drying, crushing and potentially charging with nutrients and biology.

- Kiln building collects emissions for monitoring
- Kiln building brings in fresh air for combustion through passive openings that can never fail regardless of power loss
- Kilns are arranged in lines on a **raised platform** for efficiency in draining and dumping
- Additional biomass required during the burn is stored in adjacent bins
- Biomass is loaded in bulk via loader during kiln reset and **topped up by hand** during combustion
- At completion, operators hit a **quench button** to flood the kiln with water
- After cooling and stirring, the water is **drained into a recovery tank** for reuse or soil application
- Once drained, the biochar is **dumped into a trailer** and transferred to a secondary structure for drying, weighing, grinding, and storage

Grinding and packaging are done in a separate building for safety and air quality. Finished biochar may be sold (if certified) or applied directly to the food forest. The food forest should get at least half of the biochar produced from its biomass. Biochar made from industrial waste streams could simply be sold if markets support it, or used in the food forest.

## üßä Seasonal Workflow & Throughput

To start, only the core staff would be working over the winter making biochar unless industry waste streams were found, since it has a fairly robust production capacity just from November 1 to April 30. These numbers assume a 12 hour work day, 3 days a week. The difference between an operator who can handle 2 kilns at a time and an operator that can handle 3 is substantial, so improving those efficiencies would make a large difference. Sales would also add to these figures, but assuming enough biomass could be secured, being able to produce 2 kiln runs a day per operator and the operators running at least 2 kilns themselves with a 3rd operator to reload the kilns and haul away and grind the biochar. The biochar output is enough to pay for additional seasonal food forest employees until that side brings in revenue in addition to the core staff. Once biochar sales revenue starts, that is in addition to the money we get for the credits.

**Core kiln season**: **November 1 to April 30** (26 weeks)
- **3 days per week**, 2 burns per day
- Leaves **October and May** for other off-season tasks
- **Same 3-person crew** transitions to food forest operations during the growing season

### üìê Kiln Output ‚Äì Math Breakdown (5 yd¬≥ Kiln)

Each 5 cubic yard kiln run is calculated as follows:
- 5 yd¬≥ √ó 0.7646 = **3.823 m¬≥**
- Bulk density of biochar: **250 kg/m¬≥**
- Biochar yield: 3.823 √ó 250 = **956 kg** = **0.96 tonnes of biochar**
- Biomass required (30% yield): 0.96 √∑ 0.3 = **3.19 tonnes of biomass**
- Carbon content (80%): 0.96 √ó 0.8 = **0.77 tonnes of carbon**
- CO‚ÇÇe: 0.77 √ó 3.67 = **2.81 tonnes CO‚ÇÇe sequestered per burn**
- Revenue (@ $200 CAD/tCO‚ÇÇe): 2.81 √ó 200 = **$562 CAD per burn from 3.19 tonnes of biomass**

This gives us approximately 0.88 tons of CO2 sequestered per ton of biomass (2.81 tCO2e / 3.19 tonnes biomass) or $176.18 CAD per ton of biomass processed ($562 CAD / 3.19 tons of biomass). Actual revenue will depend on total biomass available, but to look at production capacity, we have the scenarios of 2 and 3 kilns per operator twice a day, 3 days a week. This work schedule was chosen for a 4 day weekend and we could add a second shift with the same equipment easily. And of course, if workflows can be developed to operate more kilns per person, even more capacity can be added for a small crew.

### üî• Scenario: 3 Operators operating 4 kilns twice daily (1 operating the loader supporting the other 2 operators that operate 2 kilns each)
- Total burns: **624** (26 weeks √ó 3 days/week √ó 8 kilns)
- **Biochar produced**: ~**596 tonnes**
- **Biomass processed**: ~**1,988 tonnes**
- **CO‚ÇÇe sequestered**: ~**1,751 tonnes**
- **Revenue (@ $200 CAD/tCO‚ÇÇe)**: ~**$350,286 CAD** (26 weeks √ó 3 days/week √ó 2 burns/day √ó 8 kilns)

### üî• Scenario: 3 Operators operating 6 kilns twice daily (1 operating the loader supporting the other 2 operators that operate 3 kilns each)
- Total burns: **936** (26 weeks √ó 3 days/week √ó 12 kilns)
- **Biochar produced**: ~**894 tonnes**
- **Biomass processed**: ~**2,981 tonnes**
- **CO‚ÇÇe sequestered**: ~**2,627 tonnes**
- **Revenue (@ $200 CAD/tCO‚ÇÇe)**: ~**$525,383 CAD** (26 weeks √ó 3 days/week √ó 2 burns/day √ó 12 kilns)

The seasonal throughput of a single 3-person crew (8 kilns over 3 days/week during winter) sequestering over **1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide** is a critical startup capacity baseline. This is to meet Puro.Earth's minimum size requirements, and this is critically necessary as biochar carbon credits are the early financial backbone of the project. This would require a bare minimum of 1135 tons of dry biomass per year (1000 tons of CO2/ 0.88 tons of CO2 per ton of biomass), with 1500 being a safer minimum to account for any emissions that take place as part of the project which come out of the project's earnings. This level would basically be slightly above minimum wage from biochar credits alone, until soil carbon credits and biochar sales revenues start to bring that up to a more comfortable level. As productivity increases, so do wages, so employees are highly motivated to make the project succeed. That also assumes that a 3 person team could manage enough land to grow 1500 tons of biomass per year.

Areas with large industrial waste streams such as forestry could see much earlier profitability if the logistics of getting the biomass to the site are easy and cheap enough. Satellite kiln operations that ship biochar to the farms could be another option as we expand if we have sufficiently large waste streams.

Also, as no prototype has been built, these numbers are from reported figures I could find online. Prototyping, test batches and lab testing would be required to validate or correct these numbers.

## üìà Maximum Year-Round Throughput

For scaling up, two dedicated 3-person kiln crews running **6 days a week year-round** can maximize production capacity of a facility.

### üî• Scenario: 3 Operators operating 4 kilns twice daily, 6 days a week, Full-Year
- Total burns: **6 days/week √ó 8 kilns √ó 52 weeks = 2,496 burns**
- **Biochar**: ~**2,396 tonnes**
- **Biomass**: ~**7,952 tonnes**
- **CO‚ÇÇe**: ~**7,003 tonnes**
- **Revenue**: ~**$1.4 million CAD**

### üî• Scenario: 3 Operators operating 6 kilns twice daily, 6 days a week, Full-Year
- Total burns: **3,744**
- **Biochar**: ~**3,578 tonnes**
- **Biomass**: ~**11,929 tonnes**
- **CO‚ÇÇe**: ~**10,504 tonnes**
- **Revenue**: ~**$2.1 million CAD**

These numbers assume consistent feedstock quality, sufficient drying/storage capacity, and uninterrupted operations. At this scale, **on-site biomass generation is unlikely to suffice**, making reliable external partnerships essential and a key part of profitability and how much we can afford for additional summer labour, either to retrieve the biomass or to work in the food forest.

This represents the **maximum scalable throughput** for a single kiln setup with 2 full-time kiln crews. Multiple such sites could be coordinated under the same replication model and funding strategy, or longer lines of kilns could be placed in the same building if large enough, etc.

## üß™ MRV Readiness (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)

Puro.Earth requires full traceability and MRV for all credits issued.

### What we measure:
- Input biomass (by weight)
- Output biochar (by dry weight)
- Water used for quenching (reused or soil-applied)
- Emissions (monitored via chimney sensors)

### What we test:
- Carbon content
- Moisture level
- Ash content
- Volatile matter (PAHs)
- Heavy metals

Biochar must be applied to soil or sold for stable use to qualify for credits. Testing is required at least annually for both Puro and CFIA standards and may increase depending on feedstock variability.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Quench Water

- Quench water is reused for later kiln cycles or diluted and applied to the food forest
  - This would require storage if only processing biochar during the winter
- Rich in soluble nutrients and beneficial compounds if managed properly

---

## üîÑ Next Steps

- Prototype kiln, optimize dimensions
- Prototype kiln building for emissions monitoring
- Design water recovery and quench system
- Plan biochar transfer and grinding workflow
- Design waste quench water disposal in food forest
