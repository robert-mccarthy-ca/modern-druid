# üß™ MRV Protocols ‚Äì Modern Druid

Modern Druid's MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) framework is designed to meet the highest standards of soil carbon and biochar carbon credit certification while building a world-class open soil dataset.

## üìè Soil Carbon MRV

### Baseline Establishment

- **Timing**: Prior to any land disturbance or planting.
- **Sampling Depth**: Full 0‚Äì3 metre core sampling.
- **Sampling Segmentation**:
  - 0‚Äì30‚ÄØcm
  - 30‚Äì100‚ÄØcm
  - 100‚Äì300‚ÄØcm
- **Sampling Method**:
  - Direct core sampling using professional soil augers or hydraulic core samplers.
  - Georeferenced sampling locations mapped via GPS.
  - Soil pits dug to the same level for educational and illustrative purposes (show what the soil looks like year by year)
- **Sample Handling**:
  - Sealed, labelled samples by depth.
  - Delivered to accredited third-party labs for analysis.
- **Baseline Measurements**:
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration
  - Bulk density
  - Soil moisture content
  - pH, texture, and basic mineral profiles (optional)

### Ongoing Monitoring

- **Frequency**: Annually at the same time of year for consistent conditions
- **Depth**: Full 3 metres each time for maximum integrity.
- **Consistency**:
  - Resample original georeferenced points
  - Add new random points periodically to improve dataset
- **Third-Party Verification**:
  - All lab analyses from certified soil testing laboratories.

## üî• Biochar Carbon MRV

### Production Monitoring

- **Kiln Batch Logging**:
  - Input biomass weight (wet and dry)
  - Output biochar weight (post-quench and dried)
  - Kiln temperatures and burn duration records
- **Water Management**:
  - Quench water usage logged
  - Quench water reused or diluted for soil application

### Biochar Characterization

- **Testing Frequency**: Minimum annual, higher if biomass sources change.
- **Test Metrics**:
  - Carbon content
  - Ash content
  - Volatile matter
  - Moisture content
  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
  - Heavy metals (contaminant check)
- **Certification Alignment**:
  - Puro.Earth biochar protocols
  - CFIA standards for agricultural biochar products
  - OMRI organic certification for biochar sales

### Emissions Monitoring

- **Facility Design**: Kiln buildings designed as ventilated "fume hoods" with active air extraction.
- **Measurement**:
  - Periodic sampling of exhaust gases for CO‚ÇÇ, CO, VOCs, particulate matter
- **Reporting**:
  - Emissions logged but not required for credit calculation under current Puro.Earth protocol (used for transparency and compliance)

## üìú Recordkeeping Requirements

- **Digital MRV Database**:
  - Soil sample metadata
  - Core images
  - Soil pit images
  - Laboratory reports
  - Kiln run logs
  - Biochar test certificates
  - Emissions monitoring logs
- **Backup Frequency**: Weekly cloud backup
- **Data Sharing**: Publicly available summaries (for transparency), full datasets available for verification and research partnerships

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Modern Druid Project's MRV protocol is designed not only to easily meet the highest verification standards for carbon credit issuance, but also to build an unprecedented long-term record of soil regeneration and atmospheric carbon removal available for everyone.
