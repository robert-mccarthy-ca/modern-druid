# ðŸŒ³ Agroforestry Layout â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid farms are designed around syntropic agroforestry and natural farming principles with heavy biochar applications to maximize biomass, biodiversity, food quality and long-term carbon sequestration. Because biochar heavy food forests have never been a thing that our current seed sources have grown in, we will need to selectively breed our plants for production in high biochar and microbially abundant soil.

## ðŸŒ± Initial Layout Strategy

Each 25-hectare block will feature:

- **Northâ€“south oriented rows**
- **15â€¯m wild buffers** on all sides
- **Central pond (~0.1 ha)** for irrigation and resilience
- Shared infrastructure near the pond:
  - Water harvesting system
  - Power and solar generation
  - KNF and JADAM input preparation area
  - Nursery site
  - Public parking lot

The 25-hectare block size was selected to promote wildlife corridors approximately every half kilometre, enhancing biodiversity and allowing for unmanaged natural spaces. Adjacent blocks share a 30m combined wild buffer. Buffer zones will receive biochar, foliar feeds, and irrigation but will be left otherwise undisturbed allowing for natural seeding and habitat, a corridor for wildlife.

Centralized infrastructure around the pond maximizes operational efficiency: water storage, nursery space, and input preparation facilities. Public parking is another area for development if we want the public to actually use the food forest.

## ðŸŒ¾ Row Types and Planting Strategy

**Initial Planting**
- **Sunflowers**: Annual taproot openers, 1â€¯m grid spacing
- **Comfrey**: Perennial biomass species, 1â€¯m grid, offset between sunflowers
- **Daikon radish**: Additional annual taproot openers between sunflowers and comfrey
- **Groundcover mix**: Broadcast low-growing beneficial species (clover, yarrow, trefoil, purslane, etc.) with a focus on anything with a deep taproot
- **Black Locust**: Either raised in nursery, transplanted into place after sunflowers are chopped, or planted with seedballs after chop

The idea of the initial planting is to start by filling the soil column with giant taproots to break up any underlying clay and start building a soil column 3m+ deep, which is about the deepest you can sample easily. So a combination of giant sunflower and comfrey at 1m spacing each intertwined, and daikon radishes planted on a 25cm grid everywhere else. Follow up with black locust, hybrid poplar and possibly paulownia in place of the sunflowers once they flower, keeping the leaves for mulch and kilning the stems and heads, priming the tree's taproot path with the sunflower's taproot. The comfrey would be just as a mulch for the soil. The radish would be cut down at the same time and a diverse cover crop mix thrown in where it was. Row and alley planting would then start.

**Row and Alley Planting**:
- Initial soil disturbance limited to a single trench pass for tree rows.
- Named cultivars established from nursery transplants; all others seeded by seedball.
- Alley structure:
  - Either 50% edible/medicinal trees + 50% biomass trees with full biomass alleys
  - Or 100% biomass tree rows with mixed edible/biomass alley crops
- As trees mature:
  - **Annual canopy lifting** through pruning
  - **Understory planting** beneath rising canopies
  - **Succession management** by removing overly tall, poorly adapted trees, or trees that have better genetic stock to replace them
- Annual planting cycles:
  - Constant introduction of new trees and plants
  - "Cull the weak, keep the strong" to evolve the site naturally
- Biodiversity prioritized:
  - Begin with natives, expand into adjacent climate analogs
  - Use all available plants, let nature sort out the winners
- Breeding stock:
  - selectively breed for our new and evolving soil conditions, because there's never been a modern terra-pretafied natural farming syntropic agroforestry system in place, so we'll need to breed our own seed stocks.
  - even plants that do not grow true from seed like apples should be part of a breeding program, although this may take keeping different taste profiles isolated to common areas to keep the genetics from merging. A tart apple should be placed near other tart apples for example.
  - breed for vigor, yield and biomass

> Early emphasis on deep soil carbon establishment, followed by full vertical and horizontal biomass expansion. We would start by punching deep taproots all across the land, focusing on deep rooted plants that produce minimal lateral root competition, and introducing all the microbial diversity we can harvest from the local environments.

## ðŸ§ª Soil and Foliar Inputs

- **Weekly JMS and IMO applications**
- **Annual biochar application** during snow-free periods and after pruning
- **Compost** composting via Johnson-Su bioreactors
- **KNF natural inputs** for foliar and soil drenches
- **Strict no-use policy** on pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and synthetic fertilizers

**Notes:**
- Frequent microbial and foliar inputs counter rapid soil evolution stresses.
- Weekly JMS/IMO applications ensure post-biochar inoculation without needing separate pre-inoculation steps.
- Local organic waste streams (e.g., sawdust, woodchips) used as mulch where biochar is unsuitable.

## ðŸ’µ Soil Carbon Revenue Model

- Syntropic agroforestry systems typically sequester **10â€“20 tonnes COâ‚‚e per hectare per year**.
- **For a 25-hectare block**:
  - **Conservative estimate**: 250 tCOâ‚‚e/year
  - **Moderate estimate**: 375 tCOâ‚‚e/year
  - **Aggressive estimate**: 500 tCOâ‚‚e/year

- Using a **target carbon credit price of $45 CAD per tonne** (Verra + CCB soil projects):

| Estimate | Annual Soil Carbon Revenue (CAD) |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative (10 tCOâ‚‚e/ha) | ~$11,250 |
| Moderate (15 tCOâ‚‚e/ha)     | ~$16,875 |
| Aggressive (20 tCOâ‚‚e/ha)   | ~$22,500 |

> **Note**: These revenues are from soil carbon credits only and can be stacked with biochar carbon credit revenues and biochar sales for a multi-stream income model.

## ðŸ§ª MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) Requirements

- **Initial baseline soil sampling** to **3 metres depth** across project blocks before planting.
- **Direct sampling method** for MRV:
  - Full 0â€“3â€¯m core samples, divided into depth segments (e.g., 0â€“30â€¯cm, 30â€“100â€¯cm, 100â€“300â€¯cm).
  - Carbon concentration, bulk density, and moisture content measured separately by depth.
- **Annual or biennial re-sampling**:
  - Always to full depth (3â€¯m) to capture deep carbon accumulation.
  - Higher effort but critical for scientific rigor, soil profile research, and long-term credibility.
- **Additional MRV steps**:
  - Georeferenced core locations
  - Regular photo documentation
  - Third-party lab analysis for soil organic carbon (SOC)

> Choosing full-depth direct sampling increases verification credibility, builds a world-class soil dataset, and strengthens future carbon credit prices.
