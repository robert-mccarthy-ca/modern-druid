# ðŸŒ³ Agroforestry Layout â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid farms are designed around syntropic agroforestry principles to maximize biomass, biodiversity, and long-term carbon sequestration.

## ðŸŒ± Initial Layout Strategy

Each 25-hectare block will feature:

- **Northâ€“south oriented rows**
- **10â€¯m wild buffers** on all sides
- **Central pond (~0.1 ha)** for irrigation and resilience
- Shared infrastructure near pond:
  - Water harvesting system
  - Power and solar
  - Input prep (KNF, JADAM)
  - Nursery site

## ðŸŒ¾ Row Types

We use an alternating pattern of target tree rows, half edible/medicinal, half biomass and biomass alley crops.

## ðŸŒ» Seedball Strategy

- **Sunflowers**: Annual taproot to open soil, chopped in fall
- **Comfrey + Others**: Perennial biomass species, 1m grid
- **Groundcover mix**: Broadcast with clover, yarrow, trefoil, etc.
- **Tree nursery**: Interplanted within 1m grid, transplanted later

## ðŸ§ª Soil Inputs

- **JMS and IMO** applications before planting
- **Biochar** applied after inoculation with compost or microbial solutions
- Long-term composting via Johnson-Su and cover crop residue

## ðŸ”„ Planting Phases

### Phase 1 â€“ Biomass & Soil Building
- Seedballs, cover crops, early IMO/JMS work, nursery setup

### Phase 2 â€“ Food Forest Structuring
- Transplanting trees
- Establishing rows and alleys
- Pruning and succession management

> This layout evolves as we learn â€” field experiments, soil data, and yield tracking will drive refinements.
