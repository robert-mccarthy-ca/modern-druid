# ðŸŒ¿ Modern Druid â€“ Overview

Welcome to **Modern Druid**, an open-source carbon farming blueprint for building profitable, regenerative, food-producing ecosystems that remove carbon from the atmosphere.

This repository documents the development of a model farm that:
- Earns revenue through carbon credits and biochar sales
- Provides free food to the public
- Regenerates soil using syntropic agroforestry and natural farming
- Pays workers fairly from day one
- Scales globally without becoming extractive or exploitative

## ðŸ¤– Project Status

This project is currently in the **early prototyping and planning stage**.

We are:
- Assembling documentation and workflow guides
- Seeking funding and collaborators
- Preparing to build our first kiln system and secure land

## ðŸš€ How to Get Involved

You donâ€™t need to ask permission. If you want to help:
- Fork the project or open an issue
- Help sketch out kiln blueprints or processing workflows
- Help identify labs, land, or grants in Canada
- Help draft training materials or outreach content
- Help figure out licensing or open-source legal structures

This is still **just one guy and a white-hot climate deadline**. Letâ€™s build something that makes a dent.

> Start with the README for the big picture, then dig into `/docs/` to explore the subsystems.
