# 🌿 Modern Druid

**Open-source carbon farming for a livable planet.**

Modern Druid is my attempt to build/design a globally replicable, revenue-generating carbon farming model — one that sequesters atmospheric carbon, restores degraded land, and provides free food to communities — all while paying workers fairly and preparing for global deployment by 2030.

This model earns revenue from **international voluntary carbon markets**, meaning it’s largely insulated from national political will and can generate the same income level whether built in Canada, Kenya, or Cambodia.

We combine **biochar production**, **syntropic agroforestry**, and **natural farming** to build climate resilience, enrich soil, and create a blueprint for distributed, regenerative carbon removal. Each farm is designed to **spawn new farms**, creating an exponential growth curve toward global impact. Irrigation is handled sustainably through **atmospheric water harvesting** and **pond storage**, because we’ve crossed too many climate tipping points to count on historical rainfall patterns.

## 📈 Scalable Carbon Removal

A syntropic agroforestry system can produce approximately **10 tonnes of dry biomass per acre per year** in temperate climates, and up to **20–30 tonnes** in tropical zones.

Using a conservative estimate (10 tonnes/acre), we can sequester about **3.25 tonnes of CO₂ per acre per year** by converting the biomass into high-carbon biochar. To offset just **1 ppm of atmospheric CO₂** (7.81 Gt), it would take **~887 million acres** — or about **10% of global farmland**.

And that’s just the biochar. It doesn’t count the **soil carbon** captured by our perennial food forests.

With global replication, this model could remove **multiple ppm of CO₂ per year**, while providing food security, ecological regeneration, and meaningful jobs in every region of the world. It’s not just a farm — it’s a tool for **ending extractive agriculture** and replacing it with something that feeds everyone and heals everything.

## ⚡ Why Free Food?

We give the food away. All of it. Not because there isn’t profit in food — but because **there’s more carbon to draw down** if we don’t waste time on harvest logistics, sales, and transport. Let the people pick their own damn food.

And more importantly, we want to **crush degenerative industrial agriculture** with simple market forces: it's hard to compete with free.

If we can prove this model works, carbon markets will reward it, farmers will copy it, and no one will be able to justify spraying poisons on monocrops ever again.

And if I can make a comfortable living running fancy bonfires and growing ecosystems, I'm good, I don't need the other hassles.

## ⏳ Why 2030?

I’ve picked **2030** as the deadline because that’s about when I expect we hit the next wall:
- **2°C warming**
- **A Blue Ocean Arctic event**
- **Mass-casualty heat waves**
- **Major food shortages**

Maybe all the above.

That might finally be the moment the world wakes up — and when it does, it’s going to need a fully documented, globally ready carbon farming system to deploy **immediately**.

**All training will be digital and open-source.** Anyone who wants to do this isn't competing *against* us — they're competing *with* us. We're all racing against ecological collapse.

## 🌿 Why Bother?

Because I like forests. Because I like food.

Because neither the forests nor our food supply will exist in 20 years unless someone builds a way to stop the burn. And because I'd rather fix the carbon problem than chase food profits.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Profitability** from verified carbon removal credits and biochar sales
- **Replicable by 2030** and deployed to at least one new site
- **Full transparency** and open access to all workflows, designs, and verification methods
- **Non-exploitative revenue sharing**: 50% of all revenue goes to employees, equally across borders
- **Community-first food systems**: All food is free to the public
- **Global readiness**: All training materials are online, pre-recorded, and free to use

## 🔧 System Overview

### 🔥 Biochar Production
- 10 tonnes of biomass/acre converted to biochar in insulated, tiltable kilns
- Local forestry waste converted to biochar
- Quench water recovered for irrigation
- Biochar verified for carbon markets and approved for sale (CFIA, OMRI)

### 🌳 Syntropic Agroforestry
- Successional food forest system with biomass crops, nitrogen fixers, pollinators, and edible trees
- Designed with wild buffers, biodiversity grids, and resilient water infrastructure
- Biochar is applied to the soil or sold as generated

### 🧪 Natural Farming
- KNF and JADAM practices: JMS, IMO collections, FPJ, LAB, and more
- Continuous microbial input supports soil carbon and plant resilience

---

## 💸 Revenue Model

Revenue comes from:
- **Puro.Earth** biochar carbon credits
- **Verra VCS + CCB** soil carbon credits
- **CFIA/OMRI** biochar sales

> Food is always free. Excess goes to local businesses and processors.  
> “Pick your own damn food, we’re busy drawing down carbon.”

## 💰 Revenue Allocation

Each site runs on a **20-year cycle**, with revenue split as follows:

### Before Profitability
- **50% to employees**
- **50% to the local site** for infrastructure and establishment

### After Profitability
- **50% to employees**
- **20% to the local site**
- **10% to the global project**
- **20% to remote expansion** — every farm funds the next one

Once hardened (sustainable irrigation, automation, resilience):
- Profits are split 50/50 between employees and the farm manager

At the end of the 20 years:
- The farm is handed over to the local farm manager
- Then we move on to the next neglected patch of earth

## 🧭 2030 Target

By 2030, Modern Druid aims to:
- Be profitable
- Be replicated at least once
- Host a full open-source training platform
- Be ready to present to the UN as a viable, global-scale, carbon removal solution

## 🤝 Contributing

This is meant to be a community-guided project.  
Open an issue, propose improvements, or fork it to build your own farm.

> Still just one dude and a crazy idea. But let’s build the future anyway.

## 📜 License

None yet — but you’re welcome to start your own farm based on this.  
Once the project hits launchable status, it’ll be released under a permissive license that protects its purpose and ensures equitable replication.
