# 💼 Financial Model – The Modern Druid Project

The Modern Druid Project is designed to be a self-sustaining and replicating collective of carbon farms. There would be a main global company and temporary subsidiary project companies that only exist for the duration of their specific farm projects.

## 🌍 Company Structure

### 🌐 Global Parent Company

* Responsible for global expansion, education, training resources, and public R\&D.
* Receives 10% of revenue from profitable subsidiary farms.
* Reinvests revenue in:

  * Starting projects in new regions
  * Shared R\&D
  * Global training and education materials
* Profit-taking only begins when global carbon levels begin to decline.

### 🌱 Project Companies (Subsidiaries)

* Operate 20-year carbon farm projects.
* Allocate revenues:

  * 50% to employee wages and bonuses
  * 20% to improve the local farm
  * 20% to fund new farms (local replication) **once profitable, goes to local farm until then**
  * 10% to the global company **once profitable, goes to local farm until then**
* Employees promoted to managers to lead new farms, creating a self-replicating workforce.
* Farms are given to the workers upon project completion.

## 💰 Revenue Streams (100 Hectares)

### 1. **Soil Carbon Sequestration Credits (Verra + CCB)**

* Verified via direct sampling to 3 metres.
* Estimated sequestration: 4–10 tCO₂e/ha/year (based on syntropic and multistrata agroforestry literature)
* Total: 400–1,000 tCO₂e/year
* Revenue at \$45 CAD/tCO₂e: \$18,000–\$45,000/year

### 2. **Biomass Production Estimates**

* **Cold Climates (e.g. Northern Ontario)**: 3–8 t/ha/year
* **Temperate Climates**: 5–15 t/ha/year
* **Tropical Climates**: 20–25 t/ha/year

For a 100-hectare site in a temperate climate:

* Estimated biomass: 500–1,500 tonnes/year

### 3. **Biochar Carbon Credits (Puro.Earth)**

* Assume 25% yield of biochar from dry biomass
* Biochar produced: 125–375 tonnes/year
* CO₂e stored: \~2.5 tCO₂e per tonne → 313–938 tCO₂e/year
* Revenue at \$200 CAD/tCO₂e: \$62,500–\$187,500/year

### 4. **Biochar Sales**

* Assume half of biochar sold = 62.5–187.5 tonnes
* Approx. 250,000–750,000 litres
* Sales at \$0.50–\$1.00 CAD/litre: \$125,000–\$750,000/year

### 💵 **Estimated Total Annual Revenue (100 ha site, temperate region)**

| Source                 | Estimate (CAD)            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Soil Carbon Credits    | \$18,000 – \$45,000       |

## 📊 Revenue Allocation

**Before Profitability**
| Revenue Use                  | Allocation (%) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Employee wages & bonuses     | 50%            |
| Local site improvement       | 50%            |

**After Profitability**
| Revenue Use                  | Allocation (%) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Employee wages & bonuses     | 50%            |
| Local site improvement       | 20%            |
| Local new farm funding       | 20%            |
| Parent company (global R\&D) | 10%            |

This design prevents exploitation by:

* Capping wage gaps (lowest paid = ≥50% of highest paid)
* Ensuring profits benefit workers first
* Allocating funds to grow more farms
* Only taking money from farms that are profitable

---

## 🚀 Strategic Impact

* Biochar-based carbon removal is already profitable
* Revenue grows as:

  * Biomass yields increase
  * Soil carbon sequestration matures
  * Biochar market awareness improves
* Focused entirely on carbon, not food sales
* Food is free and self-harvested

This creates a globally scalable, self-replicating network of carbon farms with high community retention of revenue, equitable pay, and regenerative land use. By displacing degenerative agriculture through pure market forces and carbon revenue, we redefine what "profitable farming" means.

A regenerative carbon economy, where food is free, land is healed, and profit doesn't come at the cost of the Earth.

## 🔑 Key Viability Factors

* Biomass to biochar conversion rate
* Biomass yield per hectare
* Labour efficiency (hectares managed per person)
* Market price of carbon credits
* Biochar market development

This is the future of farming. One that heals.




# Financial Model – The Modern Druid Project

The Modern Druid Project is a self-sustaining, replicable collective of carbon farms. A Global Parent Company supports subsidiary Project Companies, each operating one 20‑year farm cycle. Revenues flow through clearly defined channels to ensure equitable pay, local reinvestment, and global growth.

* Receives 10% of subsidiary revenues once farms reach profitability
* Reinvests in:

  * New regional project launches
  * Shared R\&D and process development
  * Development of training and education materials
* Profit distributions begin only when global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have begun to fall, but would come from the global parent's budget.

### 1.2 Project Companies (Subsidiaries)

* Operate individual 100 ha carbon farms over 20‑year cycles
* Revenue allocation **before profitability**:

  * 50% → employee wages & bonuses
  * 50% → local farm improvements
* Revenue allocation **after profitability**:

  * 50% → employee wages & bonuses
  * 20% → local farm improvements

## 4. Profit & Allocation

| **Stage**          | Wages & Bonuses | Local Improvements | Replication Funds | Global R\&D |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Pre‑profitability  | 50%             | 50%                | 0%                | 0%          |
| Post‑profitability | 50%             | 20%                | 20%               | 10%         |

This ensures workers are prioritized, local farms scale sustainably, and Global R\&D is adequately funded only after local stability.

---

## 5. Strategic Impact & Scaling

* **Profit growth drivers:**

  * Increased biomass yields via breeding and inputs
  * Enhanced soil carbon as MRV records deepen
  * Biochar market maturation and premium credit pricing
* **Community benefits:** Free public harvest, job creation, equitable wage structures
* **Global replication:** New farms spin off from successful pilot sites, funded by the 20% new farm startup allocation
* **Market displacement:** Regenerative carbon farming outcompetes extractive monocultures through stacked revenue models

> *A regenerative carbon economy where food is free, land is healed, and profit aligns with planetary health.*

---

### 5.1 Company Growth Dynamics

* **Exponential Global Expansion:** Each subsidiary farm, upon reaching operational stability, promotes a manager to launch a new project company. With each farm spawning at least one successor, the Global Parent Company follows an O(eˣ) growth curve, scaling exponentially to accelerate carbon removal. Farms would continue starting new farms as the supported ones reach profitability and can sustain themselves. Individual farms would pick their own farm locations to start, but the global company would start them based on global strategies. Potential expansion limited to anything that can be irrigated today, the farms will build their own sustainable irrigation, but that will take a while.

### 5.2 Project-Level Feedback Loops

* **Soil–Biomass Positive Feedback:** Enhanced soil organic matter increases tree and understory productivity, yielding larger harvests. Increased biomass drives greater biochar production and soil amendments, further boosting fertility and sequestration capacity.
* **Revenue Amplification:** Higher biomass yields elevate biochar sales and carbon credit earnings, financing expanded planting and infrastructure, fueling a virtuous cycle of ecological and financial growth.

---

## 6. Key Viability Metrics

* **Biomass‑to‑Biochar Conversion:** Yield efficiencies & kiln throughput
* **Annual Biomass Yield:** t biomass / ha
* **Labour Efficiency:** ha managed / person
* **Credit Pricing:** Market rate for soil and biochar credits
* **Biochar Market Development:** Adoption rates and sales channels

Continual monitoring of these KPIs informs adaptive management, ensuring The Modern Druid Project remains profitable and ecosystem‑positive.
