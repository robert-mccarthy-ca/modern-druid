# ðŸ’¸ Revenue Model â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid generates revenue solely from carbon, specifically carbon removal credits and biochar sales. Biochar is created from biomass which is either grown on site or local waste streams, generating both verified durable carbon credits for sale on Puro.Earth as well as being a sellable product in its own right. Soil carbon sequestration takes place as a by product of growing a food forest and generates additional revenue through soil enhanced carbon removal credits for sale on Vera's marketplace.

Once the company is profitable, the company would be split into a global parent and project child companies. The role of the global parent company would be to focus on research and development, public relations, education and so forth while also expanding to new global regions and climates. The project companies would focus on becoming profitable first before investing in new farm startups while continuing to improve the farm. They would be dissolved after their project completes, with the farms given to the people who farmed it. At that point it should be largely automated as far as the irrigation and soil carbon growth is concerned and should continue to generate revenue for the new owner. Our farmers would get to keep their farms and retire as well.

This multi-stream model creates a resilient financial foundation, while providing free food and good jobs for communities, ensuring global scalability. This would let us keep our focus on saving the planet.

## ðŸŒ¿ Revenue Streams

### 1. **Soil Carbon Sequestration Credits (Verra + CCB)**

- **Method**: Deep soil carbon sequestration verified via direct sampling to 3 metres.
- **Volume**: ??? tonnes COâ‚‚e per hectare per year.
- **Pricing**: Target $45 CAD per tonne (aligned with high co-benefit CCB projects).
- **Scalability**: Nearly 4.8 billion hectares of farmland exist worldwide today. Limitations should mostly be geopolitical conflict zones (Russian invasion of Ukraine, or the hermit kingdom of North Korea for example).
- **Vulnerabilities**: Sustained market demand for carbon removal credits.

### 2. **Biochar Carbon Removal Credits (Puro.Earth)**

- **Method**: Biochar production from biomass grown onsite or sourced locally.
- **Volume**: Based on kiln capacity and burn schedule.
- **Pricing**: ~$200 CAD per tonne of COâ‚‚e stored (recent Puro.Earth average).
- **Scalability**: Limited only by biomass supply.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Sustained market demand for carbon removal credits.

### 3. **Biochar Product Sales**

- **Method**: Certified CFIA/OMRI biochar sold for agricultural and horticultural use.
- **Volume**: No more than half of what is grown on-site. Biochar generated from local waste streams can be sold or applied as the market demands.
- **Pricing**: Estimated retail ~$0.50â€“$1.00 CAD per litre bulk equivalent.
- **Scalability**: High, but the market is still at an early stage. Agriculture and horticulture would be the largest initial markets, but other emerging markets such as concrete and asphalt aggregate replacement, water filtration and packaging.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Reliant on market demand for a product that not many know about. The most vulnerable of the three revenue streams, public education would be important.

## ðŸ“ˆ Revenue Stacking Model (Per 25 Hectares)

| Revenue Source            | Estimate (Annual)        |
|----------------------------|-----|
| Soil Carbon Credits        | ??? |
| Biochar Carbon Credits     | ??? |
| Biochar Sales              | ??? |

> **Note**: These revenues are only from soil and biochar carbon credits, plus biochar sales. Timber harvests are not currently a revenue stream during the project life cycle, as tree rotation focuses on adaptive breeding. This approach would be revised once global climate stabilizes, but until then adaptive breeding would remain the priority, not only because this type of soil has never existed before and we need seeds adapted to it, but also the need for adaptations to new climatic conditions since our weather won't stop changing until we stop climate change.

## Earnings Distribution

**Before Profitability**:
- 50% revenue to employees, start with a basic wage with the remainder as an annual bonus.
- 50% for debt payments, farm purchases, irrigation and other non-labour costs.

**After Profitability**:
- 50% revenue to employees, same as before.
- 20% for continued local development of the site.
- 20% for remote expansion, funding new child company startups.
- 10% to the global parent company

Employees always earn half of all revenue. The farmers are the ones drawing carbon from the atmosphere and need to be paid and paid well in order to expand to the millions that we need in order to make a dent in the CO2 levels. The rest of the copmany is fairly low input, mostly in organic inputs for KNF and Jadam preparations. The local budget would mostly be to continue to improve the irrigation, both the physical infrastructure and the sustainably harvested water supply. The remote budget would be to fund the startup of other farms until they in turn are profitable, at which point the next farm is funded. The parent company only collects revenue from profitable child companies, not the ones still struggling, those ones get financial support until they become profitable. The parent company focuses on global operations, research and development, educational and training materials and expansion into other parts of the world and in other climates.

Only once atmospheric CO2 levels begin to drop would profit taking begin from the global parent company's coffers. The owners get paid when they successfully halt runaway greenhouse gases, whether alone or in cooperation with the rest of the world is irrelevant. Until then, the money is needed to draw more carbon from the atmosphere. Once we've reached that point, the exponential nature of growth you get from having every farm continue to spawn new farms should be enough to continue on it's own. It should be self sustaining at this point. Let the carbon farmers make the money. Let's make this a real career option worldwide and a sexy one at that. With earnings based on the price of carbon on a burning world. We'll need tens of millions of people to do be doing this if we want to hit parts per million per month in CO2 drawdown. And we really really need to be at this point.

## ðŸ§  Strategic Priorities

- **Year 1**:
  - Seek industrial waste streams for increased biochar production capability.
  - Build baseline soil carbon for long-term soil credit revenue.
  - Gather initial soil cultures for IMO and JMS.
  - Inoculating the soil across the entire site.
  - Setting up a nursery.
  - Plant initial placenta species across the entire site, focusing on strong deep taproots that can break up clay. Living carbon spikes everywhere to loosen up and deepen the soil.
  - Process the biomass into biochar over the winter.

- **Year 2 - Profitability**:
  - Begin online biochar sales once CFIA/OMRI certification is secured.
  - Begin planting the food forest rows and alleys, with additional species and trees planted every year as the canopies rise.
  - Begin applying the produced biochar and any other non-kilnable mulch biomass to the food forest as maintenance and pruning takes place.
  - Strengthen soil credit claims with multi-year MRV data.
  - Install and improve the irrigation.

- **Profitable Phase**:
  - Prioritize breeding and selecting tree lines adapted to high-carbon, microbially active soils.
  - Continue generational replanting cycles to enhance soil performance and biodiversity.
  - Fund additional child companies, with 20% of revenues being budgetted for this.
  - Continue to improve irrigation, foliar feeding and water harvesting.
  - Improve operational efficiency and reduce labour through automation.

# âœ… Conclusion

Modern Druid's regenerative system is designed for **resilient, stacked revenue from carbon** without compromising its mission to heal the land, pull carbon from the atmosphere, and provide free food access. A company that does good and good alone and still pulls off a profit. We're here for the carbon, not your lands and resources, you can have it back when we're done, healthier and more productive than ever before.
