# 💼 Financial Model – The Modern Druid Project

The Modern Druid Project is designed to be a self-sustaining and replicating collective of carbon farms. There would be a main global company and temporary subsidiary project companies that only exist for the duration of their specific farm projects.

## 🌍 Company Structure

### 🌐 Global Parent Company

* Responsible for global expansion, education, training resources, and public R\&D.
* Receives 10% of revenue from profitable subsidiary farms.
* Reinvests revenue in:

  * Starting projects in new regions
  * Shared R\&D
  * Global training and education materials
* Profit-taking only begins when global carbon levels begin to decline.

### 🌱 Project Companies (Subsidiaries)

* Operate 20-year carbon farm projects.
* Allocate revenues:

  * 50% to employee wages and bonuses
  * 20% to improve the local farm
  * 20% to fund new farms (local replication) **once profitable, goes to local farm until then**
  * 10% to the global company **once profitable, goes to local farm until then**
* Employees promoted to managers to lead new farms, creating a self-replicating workforce.
* Farms are given to the workers upon project completion.

## 💰 Revenue Streams (100 Hectares)

### 1. **Soil Carbon Sequestration Credits (Verra + CCB)**

* Verified via direct sampling to 3 metres.
* Estimated sequestration: 4–10 tCO₂e/ha/year (based on syntropic and multistrata agroforestry literature)
* Total: 400–1,000 tCO₂e/year
* Revenue at \$45 CAD/tCO₂e: \$18,000–\$45,000/year

### 2. **Biomass Production Estimates**

* **Cold Climates (e.g. Northern Ontario)**: 3–8 t/ha/year
* **Temperate Climates**: 5–15 t/ha/year
* **Tropical Climates**: 20–25 t/ha/year

For a 100-hectare site in a temperate climate:

* Estimated biomass: 500–1,500 tonnes/year

### 3. **Biochar Carbon Credits (Puro.Earth)**

* Assume 25% yield of biochar from dry biomass
* Biochar produced: 125–375 tonnes/year
* CO₂e stored: \~2.5 tCO₂e per tonne → 313–938 tCO₂e/year
* Revenue at \$200 CAD/tCO₂e: \$62,500–\$187,500/year

### 4. **Biochar Sales**

* Assume half of biochar sold = 62.5–187.5 tonnes
* Approx. 250,000–750,000 litres
* Sales at \$0.50–\$1.00 CAD/litre: \$125,000–\$750,000/year

### 💵 **Estimated Total Annual Revenue (100 ha site, temperate region)**

| Source                 | Estimate (CAD)            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Soil Carbon Credits    | \$18,000 – \$45,000       |
| Biochar Carbon Credits | \$62,500 – \$187,500      |
| Biochar Sales          | \$125,000 – \$750,000     |
| **Total**              | **\$205,500 – \$982,500** |

## 📊 Revenue Allocation

**Before Profitability**
| Revenue Use                  | Allocation (%) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Employee wages & bonuses     | 50%            |
| Local site improvement       | 50%            |

**After Profitability**
| Revenue Use                  | Allocation (%) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Employee wages & bonuses     | 50%            |
| Local site improvement       | 20%            |
| Local new farm funding       | 20%            |
| Parent company (global R\&D) | 10%            |

This design prevents exploitation by:

* Capping wage gaps (lowest paid = ≥50% of highest paid)
* Ensuring profits benefit workers first
* Allocating funds to grow more farms
* Only taking money from farms that are profitable

## 🚀 Strategic Impact

* Biochar-based carbon removal is already profitable
* Revenue grows as:

  * Biomass yields increase
  * Soil carbon sequestration matures
  * Biochar market awareness improves
* Focused entirely on carbon, not food sales
* Food is free and self-harvested

This creates a globally scalable, self-replicating network of carbon farms with high community retention of revenue, equitable pay, and regenerative land use. By displacing degenerative agriculture through pure market forces and carbon revenue, we redefine what "profitable farming" means.

A regenerative carbon economy, where food is free, land is healed, and business doesn't come at the cost of the Earth.

## 🔑 Key Viability Factors

* Biomass to biochar conversion rate
* Biomass yield per hectare
* Labour efficiency (hectares managed per person)
* Market price of carbon credits
* Biochar market development

This is the future of farming. One that heals.
