# 🌿 The Modern Druid Project

**Introducing carbon farming as a profession for a livable planet.**

The Modern Druid Project is my attempt to design (and hopefully one day get to build) a globally scalable, revenue-generating carbon farming model — one that sequesters meaningful levels of atmospheric carbon, raises the fertility of the land, provides free food and good wages to the communities they're based in. The idea is to run 20 year projects where we buy the land, build a community food forest where we grow biomass for biochar in the growing season, convert it to biochar over the winter, earning our revenue from carbon. Carbon removal credits through Puro.Earth, carbon removal credits through Vera, and biochar sales. The food is free to the public. We're busy drawing down carbon. Pick your own damn food.

Ecological sustainability is not the only sustainability effort we will be undertaking. We also plan to pay our employees equitably with 50% of revenue going to employee wages. We would also cap the wage gap between new hire and farm manager to a factor of 2 based on hours worked. Keep all employees directly and meaningfully motivated to outperform anything the world has ever seen before. At the end of the project, the farmers who worked that project get to keep the land. Scalable to multiple parts per million of carbon dioxide removal annually as long as the price of carbon doesn't fall too low. Since carbon markets crashing would require substantial climate progress, that worst case scenario would present its own opportuniites for UN level policy input.

Ideally this would eventually be a using UN regulated carbon removal market system, but that doesn't exist today. The closest we have are **national regulated carbon markets** which are subject to the whims of politics but have more stable prices and **international voluntary carbon markets**, which are politically resilient but susceptible to market forces. We plan to target the voluntary carbon markets for now, which means that this model would produce the same wages and earnings in Canada as in Peru or Kenya. Globally reproducible. It also has the potential to meet 12 of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, so we would be aiming at Vera + CCB for our soil carbon credits. And simply by not going for all the profits, by not being too greedy, we can give the food away for free and put the first nail in the coffin of the biocide based destructive agriculture industry that is destroying the world's soils. Let them compete with fresh, local, organic and free.

We combine **biochar production**, **syntropic agroforestry**, and **natural farming** to build climate resilience, enrich soil, and create a blueprint for distributed, regenerative carbon removal. Each farm is designed to continously **spawn new farms** as part of its operating budget, creating an exponential growth curve to fuel enough expansion to make a meaningful global impact. Whatever biochar is not sold is applied to the food forest. The microbial life of our soils need to be actively enhanced, both in quantity and diversity, something that natural farming excels at. Irrigation will need to be upgraded to sustainably harvest and store water through **pond storage** and **atmospheric water harvesting** or **desalination** depending on the area. We’ve crossed too many climate tipping points to count on historical rainfall patterns anymore, and without water, our forests burn. This can be boostrapped anywhere with water today, but it will be fragile in the face of the several degrees of warming we appear to be headed for. Without water, forests burn, food forests included.

## 📈 Scalable Carbon Removal

Syntropic agroforestry systems can reliably produce **10 tonnes of dry biomass per acre per year** in temperate climates, and up to **20–30 tonnes** in tropical zones or more as they mature.

Using a conservative estimate (10 tonnes/acre), we can sequester about **3.25 tonnes of CO₂ per acre per year** by converting the biomass into high-carbon biochar. To offset just **1 ppm of atmospheric CO₂** (7.81 Gt), it would take **~887 million acres** — or about **10% of global farmland**. With global replication, this model could remove **multiple ppm of CO₂ per year**, while providing food security, ecological regeneration, and meaningful jobs in every region of the world. And that’s just the biochar. That doesn’t even count the **soil carbon** captured by perennial food forests. Improving soil quality and as the food forests get larger, these impacts should continue to increase year after year. Together, atmospheric CO2 removal at the rate of ppm per month is potentially possible while also feeding the world and providing meaningful employment and local wages worldwide.

This would require international regulatory carbon markets with a minimum price to scale to that size, but to get there, we need to show that carbon markets can work at meaningful levels. Using the voluntary carbon markets, this project will attempt to demonstrate that a price on carbon can indeed draw down carbon in a substantial way and can be used to end the land management practices that are destroying the soil carbon reserves globally.

No greenwashing. Real carbon drawdown that people can see, touch and even taste themselves.

## ⚡ Why Free Food?

We give the food away. All of it. What people don't eat can be exported by enterprising locals. Not because there isn’t profit in food — but because **there’s more carbon we can draw down** if we don’t waste time on harvest logistics, sales, and transport. Let the people pick their own damn food, we're busy sequestering carbon. To **crush extractive, degenerative, toxin-based, ecologically destructive industrial agriculture** with simple market forces: our food is free ... compete with that. It’s not just a farm — it’s a tool for **ending extractive agriculture** and replacing it with something that feeds everyone and heals everything. Paying for the privilege of eating is a business model that no longer needs to exist.

If we can prove this model works, carbon markets will reward it, farmers will copy it, and no one will be able to justify spraying poisons on monocrops ever again.

And on a personal note, if I can make a comfortable living gardening like a boss at scale and having fancy bonfires, I'm good, I don't need the other hassles. I just have to make carbon farming a thing first in order to do that.

## ⏳ Why 2030?

I’ve picked **2030** as my target deadline because that’s about when I expect we hit the next wall:
- **2°C warming**
- **A Blue Ocean Arctic event**
- **Mass-casualty heat waves**
- **Major food shortages**

Maybe all the above.

That might finally be the moment the world wakes up to the urgency required to reverse climate change — and when it does, it’s going to need a fully documented, globally ready carbon farming system to deploy **immediately**.

**All training materials will be digital and freely available.** The same training materials we would use ourselves would be available to anyone who wants to do this (probably on YouTube). They aren't competing *against* us — they're competing *with* us. We're all racing against ecological collapse and our own extinction.

## 🌿 Why Bother?

Because I like forests. Because I like food. Because I live here. Because neither the forests nor our food supply will exist here or anywhere else in 20 years unless someone builds a way to stop runaway carbon dioxide levels. Because you shouldn't have to pay for the privilege of eating. Because profitable business doesn't have to be exploitatively predatory. Because the world is being burned down by industrial agriculturalists and they need to be stopped. Because humans don't survive several degrees of warming without decentralized and stable food production.

## 🚀 2030 Project Goals

- **Profitability** from verified carbon removal credits and biochar sales
- **Replicable and deployed** to at least one new site
- **Full transparency** and open access to all workflows, designs, project application forms, and verification methods that people would need to start their own
- **Non-exploitative revenue sharing**: 50% of all farm revenue goes to employees, equally across borders, but each farm is separate so every farm worker has a very direct incentive to make their site succeed
- **Community-first food systems**: All food is free to the public, always, no exceptions, we regenerate everything, from the soil and water table, to plants, insects and animals, to the people who rely on them.
- **Global readiness**: All training materials are online, pre-recorded, and free to use

## 🔧 System Overview

### 🔥 Biochar Production
- Purpose grown biomass converted to biochar in insulated, tiltable kilns
- Local forestry waste converted to biochar
- Quench water recovered for irrigation
- Biochar verified for carbon markets (Puro.Earth) and approved for commercial sale (CFIA, OMRI)
- 50%+ of the purpose grown biochar added to the soil of the food forest, continuously building a modern analog of terra preta

### 🌳 Syntropic Agroforestry
- Successional food forest system with high biomass crops, nitrogen fixers, pollinators, and edible trees
- Designed with wild buffers, biodiversity, and resilient water infrastructure in mind
- Unsold biochar is applied to the soil, no waste
- More efficient methods can be used to grow food when you don't have to worry about harvesting or selling the product, the only harvesting is biomass during pruning cycles.

### 🧪 Natural Farming
- KNF and JADAM practices: JMS, IMO collections, FPJ, LAB, and more
- Continuous microbial input supports soil health and biodiversity as it progresses through its successional phases

## 💸 Revenue Model

Revenue comes from:
- **Puro.Earth** biochar carbon removal credits
- **Verra VCS + CCB** soil carbon removal credits
- **Biochar sales**

The primary risk factor on earnings prices is market demand, but as we haven't even slowed down our emissions yet, that's unlikely to be a short or even a long term threat.

> Food is always free. Excess goes to local businesses, processors and entrepeneurs.
> “Pick your own damn food, we’re busy drawing down carbon.”

## 💰 Revenue Allocation

Each site runs on a **20-year cycle**, with revenue split as follows:

### Before Profitability
- **50% to employees** with a basic minimum income until profitable, but directly related to site performance
- **50% to the local site** for infrastructure establishment, debt payments, and all other non-labour costs involved in becoming profitable and sustainable

### After Profitability
- **50% to employees**
- **20% to the local site** - ongoing non-labour expenses, site improvements and other assorted costs
- **10% to the global company** - goes towards research and development, publicly accessible education, remote expansion to new regions, all other non-site specific projects and costs, and any profit taking (after the climate stabilizes and CO2 levels start dropping)
- **20% to starting new farms** — every farm continuously funds new farms as a standard core practice, it's the only way to get an exponential growth curve, and we need that right now

At the end of the 20 years:
- The farm is handed over to the farmers who ran it
- The company would leave behind fertile food forests with local ownership in its wake

This should be a model welcomed into nearly every community on Earth as a result of all the benefits. Profits don't require predatory levels of exploitation. If this can be viable in Canada, which I believe it can be, this can be brought anywhere with farmland today. The initial size of farm needs to be something on the order of 100-200 hectares to reliably hit the Puro minimum project production levels, but after that, smaller expansions should be possible. The aim being to have 5-10 people per farm, with employees having the opportunity to run their own farms as the farm spawns new farms. There should be a constant churn of new farm manager trainees since expansion is core to the model. The people that make the money are the people who help remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Carbon Farming can be a career, it can be a sexy career in fact. Farming without sales. Gardening at scale when things are growing, having fancy bonfires and other tasks over the winter months, year round work. And we need it to be in order to get enough people interested in doing so in order to succeed at stopping and reversing our rising CO2 levels. This should be replicable until there's no more farmland or no more people to do the farming. Let's start with getting that to be our biggest problem.
