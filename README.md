# 🌿 Modern Druid

**Introducing carbon farming as a profession for a livable planet.**

Modern Druid is my attempt to design (and hopefully build) a globally scalable, revenue-generating carbon farming model — one that sequesters meaningful levels of atmospheric carbon, regenerates nearly any farmland or any other underutilized land, and provides free food to the communities they're based in. 20 year projects where we buy the land, build a community food forest and grow biomass for biochar, earning our revenue from carbon removal credits in international voluntary carbon markets, and pay our employees equitably with a 50% of revenue going to employee wages. Cap the wage gap between new hire and farm manager to double based on hours worked. Keep all employees directly and meaningfully motivated to outperform anything the world has ever seen before. At the end of the project, the farmers who worked that project get to keep the land. Scalable to multiple parts per million of carbon dioxide removal annually as long as the price of carbon doesn't fall. Since that would basically take solving the carbon crisis to cause it, I can live with the risk of climate change being a solved problem within a few years. 

Ideally this would eventually be a using UN based carbon removal market system, but that doesn't exist today. The closest we have are the voluntary carbon markets, which are international ... so you can make the same amount of money doing this in Canada as you can in Uruguay or Kenya. Globally reproducible. This model earns revenue from **international voluntary carbon markets**, meaning it’s largely insulated from national political will. It also meets 9 out of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, so hopefully we get a good price on our credits. And simply by not going for all the profits, by not being too greedy, we can give the food away for free and put the first nail in the coffin of the biocide based destructive agriculture industry that is destroying the world's soils. It's hard to compete with free after all.

We combine **biochar production**, **syntropic agroforestry**, and **natural farming** to build climate resilience, enrich soil, and create a blueprint for distributed, regenerative carbon removal. Each farm is designed to continously **spawn new farms**, creating an exponential growth curve toward an actual global impact. Irrigation will need to be upgraded to sustainably harvest and store water through **pond storage** and **atmospheric water harvesting** or **desalination** depending on the area, because we’ve crossed too many climate tipping points to count on historical rainfall patterns and forests burn. This can be boostrapped anywhere with water today, but it will be fragile in the face of several degrees of global warming without irrigation, which appears to be where we're headed.

## 📈 Scalable Carbon Removal

A syntropic agroforestry system can produce approximately **10 tonnes of dry biomass per acre per year** in temperate climates, and up to **20–30 tonnes** in tropical zones.

Using a conservative estimate (10 tonnes/acre), we can sequester about **3.25 tonnes of CO₂ per acre per year** by converting the biomass into high-carbon biochar. To offset just **1 ppm of atmospheric CO₂** (7.81 Gt), it would take **~887 million acres** — or about **10% of global farmland**. With global replication, this model could remove **multiple ppm of CO₂ per year**, while providing food security, ecological regeneration, and meaningful jobs in every region of the world. And that’s just the biochar. That doesn’t even count the **soil carbon** captured by perennial food forests. 

This will require international regulatory carbon markets with a minimum price, but to get there, we need to show that carbon markets can work at scale. Using the voluntary carbon markets, this project will attempt to demonstrate that a price on carbon can indeed draw down carbon in a meaningful way and can be used to end the land management practices that are destroying the soil carbon reserves globally.

## ⚡ Why Free Food?

We give the food away. All of it. Not because there isn’t profit in food — but because **there’s more carbon to draw down** if we don’t waste time on harvest logistics, sales, and transport. Let the people pick their own damn food, we're busy sequestering carbon.

And more importantly, we want to **crush degenerative industrial agriculture** with simple market forces: it's hard to compete with free. It’s not just a farm — it’s a tool for **ending extractive agriculture** and replacing it with something that feeds everyone and heals everything.

If we can prove this model works, carbon markets will reward it, farmers will copy it, and no one will be able to justify spraying poisons on monocrops ever again.

And on a personal note, if I can make a comfortable living running fancy bonfires and growing ecosystems, I'm good, I don't need the other hassles. I just have to make carbon farming a thing in order to do that.

## ⏳ Why 2030?

I’ve picked **2030** as the deadline because that’s about when I expect we hit the next wall:
- **2°C warming**
- **A Blue Ocean Arctic event**
- **Mass-casualty heat waves**
- **Major food shortages**

Maybe all the above.

That might finally be the moment the world wakes up — and when it does, it’s going to need a fully documented, globally ready carbon farming system to deploy **immediately**.

**All training will be digital and open-source.** Anyone who wants to do this isn't competing *against* us — they're competing *with* us. We're all racing against ecological collapse.

## 🌿 Why Bother?

Because I like forests. Because I like food.

Because neither the forests nor our food supply will exist in 20 years unless someone builds a way to stop the burn. And because I'd rather fix the carbon problem than chase food profits.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Profitability** from verified carbon removal credits and biochar sales
- **Replicable by 2030** and deployed to at least one new site
- **Full transparency** and open access to all workflows, designs, and verification methods
- **Non-exploitative revenue sharing**: 50% of all farm revenue goes to employees, equally across borders, but each farm is separate so every farm worker has a very direct incentive to succeed
- **Community-first food systems**: All food is free to the public
- **Global readiness**: All training materials are online, pre-recorded, and free to use

## 🔧 System Overview

### 🔥 Biochar Production
- 10 tonnes of biomass/acre converted to biochar in insulated, tiltable kilns
- Local forestry waste converted to biochar
- Quench water recovered for irrigation
- Biochar verified for carbon markets (Puro.Earth) and approved for sale (CFIA, OMRI)

### 🌳 Syntropic Agroforestry
- Successional food forest system with biomass crops, nitrogen fixers, pollinators, and edible trees
- Designed with wild buffers, biodiversity, and resilient water infrastructure
- Unsold biochar is applied to the soil

### 🧪 Natural Farming
- KNF and JADAM practices: JMS, IMO collections, FPJ, LAB, and more
- Continuous microbial input supports soil carbon and plant resilience

## 💸 Revenue Model

Revenue comes from:
- **Puro.Earth** biochar carbon credits
- **Verra VCS + CCB** soil carbon credits
- **CFIA/OMRI** biochar sales

The risk factor on earnings prices is basically whether the world stops the rise of carbon dioxide or not, whether so much carbon is coming out that we're dropping back down. I can live with that risk since we haven't slowed down yet as far as global emissions go.

> Food is always free. Excess goes to local businesses and processors.  
> “Pick your own damn food, we’re busy drawing down carbon.”

## 💰 Revenue Allocation

Each site runs on a **20-year cycle**, with revenue split as follows:

### Before Profitability
- **50% to employees** with a basic minimum income until profitable, but directly related to site performance
- **50% to the local site** for infrastructure establishment, debt payments, and all other non-labour costs involved in becoming profitable and sustainable

### After Profitability
- **50% to employees**
- **20% to the local site** - ongoing non-labour expenses, site improvements and other assorted costs
- **10% to the global company** - goes towards research and development, publicly accessible education, remote expansion to new regions, all other non-site specific projects and costs, and any profit taking (after the climate stabilizes and CO2 levels start dropping)
- **20% to starting new farms** — every farm continuously funds new farms as a standard core practice, it's the only way to get an exponential growth curve, and we need that right now

At the end of the 20 years:
- The farm is handed over to the farmers who ran it
- Then we move on to the next neglected patch of earth, we're looking to heal the land, not conquer it.

This should be a model welcomed into nearly every community on Earth as a result of all the benefits. Profits don't require predatory levels of exploitation. If this can be viable in Canada, which I believe it can be, this can be brought anywhere with farmland today. The initial size of farm needs to be something on the order of 100-200 hectares to reliably hit the Puro minimum project production levels, but after that, smaller expansions should be possible. The aim being to have 5-10 people per farm, with employees having the opportunity to run their own farms as the farm spawns new farms. There should be a constant churn of new farm manager trainees since expansion is core to the model. The people that make the money are the people who help remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Carbon Farming can be a career, it can be a sexy career in fact. Farming without sales. Gardening at scale when things are growing, having fancy bonfires and other tasks over the winter months, year round work. And we need it to be in order to get enough people interested in doing so in order to succeed at stopping and reversing our rising CO2 levels. This should be replicable until there's no more farmland or no more people to do the farming. Let's start with getting that to be our biggest problem.
