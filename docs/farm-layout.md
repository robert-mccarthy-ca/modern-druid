# ðŸŒ³ Agroforestry Layout â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid farms are designed around syntropic agroforestry and natural farming principles to maximize biomass, biodiversity, and long-term carbon sequestration.

## ðŸŒ± Initial Layout Strategy

Each 25-hectare block will feature:

- **Northâ€“south oriented rows**
- **10â€¯m wild buffers** on all sides
- **Central pond (~0.1 ha)** for irrigation and resilience
- Shared infrastructure near the pond:
  - Water harvesting system
  - Power and solar
  - Input preparation (KNF, JADAM)
  - Nursery site

The 25-hectare block size was chosen to allow wildlife corridors approximately every half kilometre, promoting biodiversity and offering unmanaged spaces. Adjacent blocks would share a 20â€¯m combined wild buffer. Buffer zones will receive biochar, foliars, and irrigation but no pruning or disturbance beyond that. 

Central infrastructure clusters around the pond to maximize efficiency: nursery space, water storage, and workspace for KNF input preparation.

## ðŸŒ¾ Row Types

- Alternating patterns of target tree rows:
  - **50% edible/medicinal focus**
  - **50% biomass focus**
- Biomass alley crops integrated between rows

## ðŸŒ» Seedball Strategy for Planting

- **Sunflowers**: Annual taproot openers, 1â€¯m grid spacing
- **Comfrey**: Perennial biomass species, 1â€¯m grid, offset between sunflowers
- **Daikon radish**: Additional annual taproot openers planted between comfrey and sunflowers
- **Groundcover mix**: Broadcast low-growing, beneficial species (clover, yarrow, trefoil, purslane, etc.)
- **Biomass Trees**: Started in nursery, transplanted in fall after sunflowers are chopped down

**Planting Workflow**:
- Sunflowers are planted on a 1â€¯m grid to punch initial holes through the soil.
- Comfrey seeded offset between sunflower grid points.
- Daikon radishes interplanted between comfrey and sunflower points.
- A diverse groundcover is broadcast throughout.
- In the fall, sunflowers are chopped and replaced by biomass trees transplanted from the nursery.
- Minimal soil disturbance beyond initial tree row trenching; future plantings rely on seedballs and transplanting only.

## ðŸ§ª Soil Inputs

- **Weekly JMS and IMO applications**
- **Biochar** applied post-inoculation (JMS, IMO, Johnson-Su)
- Long-term composting via Johnson-Su bioreactors and cover crop residues
- **KNF natural inputs** for foliar and soil drenching
- **No pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, or synthetic fertilizers**

> Waste streams unsuitable for biochar kilns (like woodchips and sawdust) are repurposed for soil building as mulch.

## ðŸ”„ Planting Phases

### Phase 1 â€“ Biomass & Soil Building
- Land clearing and soil preparation
- Early IMO and JMS applications
- Broadcasting seedballs and cover crops
- Establishing nursery site

### Phase 2 â€“ Food Forest Structuring
- Transplanting trees from nursery
- Planting diverse understory species via seedballs
- Organizing permanent rows and alleys
- Pruning and managing plant succession dynamics

### Phase 3 â€“ Continuous Improvement and R&D

- **Irrigation**: 
  - Automated irrigation systems scalable from groundwater/surface water to atmospheric harvesting
- **Biochar Production**:
  - Streamlining and automating biochar workflows with conveyor and grinder systems
- **Drone Use**:
  - Drone seeding, foliar feeding, and field scouting before fixed irrigation is deployed
- **Breeding Program**:
  - Breeding new plant lines specifically adapted to high-biochar, microbially active soils
- **Augmented Reality Integration**:
  - AR glasses/headsets for visual planting grids and live field data collection
- **Knowledge Documentation**:
  - Open-access media documentation (e.g., YouTube) for transparent global replication

See [`docs/farm-rnd.md`](../farm-rnd.md) for expanded research and development goals.

> **This layout evolves as we learn** â€” Field trials, soil data, and yield tracking will drive continuous improvements.
