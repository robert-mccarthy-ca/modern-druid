## üî• Biochar Production ‚Äì Modern Druid

The core of the Modern Druid carbon farm is a line of **flame-cap kilns** designed for small teams to produce high-quality biochar safely and efficiently. These kilns are low-tech, built from local materials, and require only modest engineering support for safe construction and emissions monitoring. Once operational, they're essentially large controlled bonfires quenched with water when combustion finishes.

Kilns are:

* Fixed in place
* Filled by loader and hand-topped during burns
* Quenched automatically with overhead water spray
* Emptied into trailers for drying, crushing, and storage

The major challenge is logistics‚Äîbut we can simplify this by growing our own biomass and using the biochar ourselves. Any surplus can be sold online.

## üõ† Kiln Design Goals

* **Fixed, insulated, tiltable kilns** for easy unloading and minimal downtime
* **Automated quench & drain system** to reduce labour and risk

## üõ† Kiln Building Design Goals

* **Open-air windbreak-style building** with active chimney exhaust (a giant fume hood)
* **MRV-compliant emissions monitoring** in chimneys
* **All-weather safety**: snow, wind, rain, and built-in fire suppression
* **Separate grinding area** to prevent dust ignition risks

## üî• Kiln Workflow

1. Load kilns and biomass bins
2. Start fires
3. Feed kilns from nearby bins until complete
4. Quench with overhead spray
5. Drain water to quench tank (reuse or food forest application)
6. Dump char into trailer
7. Dry (drip-dry)
8. Weigh
9. Crush and screen
10. (Optional) Charge with Jadam Liquid Fertilizer (JLF)
11. Apply to food forest or ship to customers

Flame-cap kilns rely on pyrolysis: oxygen is consumed by the flame before it reaches the fuel. The char doesn‚Äôt turn to ash and remains highly stable for centuries. Kiln crews consist of 2 operators and 1 loader/driver for safety and efficiency.

The ideal is 3+ kilns per operator, running 2 burns per day. Kiln size (starting with 5 yd¬≥) will be finalized during prototyping. The design draws inspiration from Ring of Fire kilns but adds insulation, tilting platforms, automated quenching, and MRV-ready monitoring systems.

## üî• Facility Layout

* Kilns and fuel bins on either side of a central aisle (trailer-accessible)
* Sunken aisle (optional) for easy dumping
* Side-open kiln building (passive safety from gas buildup or oxygen depletion)
* Active chimney exhaust draws emissions through sensors for Puro compliance

Grinding and packaging occur in a separate building. Half the biochar at minimum stays on-site for food forest use. Biochar from industrial waste can be sold or used depending on market demand.

## üßä Seasonal Workflow & Throughput

The goal: a 3-person crew grows 1,500+ tonnes of biomass annually and converts it into biochar (to meet Puro.Earth's minimum project size) in winter with time to spare for winter nursery tasks.

**Kiln Season:** November 1 to April 30 (26 weeks)

* 312 kiln runs (26 weeks, 3 days/week, 2 burns/day, 2 kiln operators)
* October and May for other tasks
* Same team switches to food forest duties in growing season

### üìê Kiln Output (Per 5 yd¬≥ Kiln Run)

* Biochar: \~956 kg (0.96 t)
* Biomass needed (30% yield): \~3.19 t
* CO‚ÇÇe: \~2.81 tCO‚ÇÇe
* Revenue (@ \$200 CAD/tCO‚ÇÇe): \~\$562 CAD

### 1500 Tonnes of Biomass

* Burns Needed: 470
* Biochar: \~450 t
* Biomass: 1500 t
* CO‚ÇÇe: \~1320 t
* Revenue: \~\$264,000 CAD

With the bare minimum of 1500 tons per year, we are left with $132,000 to pay for 3 employees from biochar carbon credits alone, and another $132,000 to pay for non-wage costs. Soil carbon credits and biochar sales would make the difference between minimum wages and comfortable ones. Those revenues would also increase the rest of the site's budget. Long term growth of the site should continue to push these numbers up, but may incur additional labour as well. The prices of carbon credits on their respective markets would directly impact revenues and employee earnings.

Since we only have 312 burn runs possible during the proposed workweek, kiln operators would need to keep at least 2 kilns running each, with being capable of maintaining more kilns per operator increasing capacity quickly. Additional crews could easily be added, or operations could continue throughout the year if local fire regulations allow and enough biomass was available.

Revenues continue to go up as additional biomass is processed into biochar, either from food forest productivity increases or from local waste streams. Consequently, regions with high-waste industries (e.g., forestry) could scale faster and possibly warrant year round operation of kilns. Satellite kiln sites may be viable with sufficient biomass availability.

### Biochar Sales

* 140-170 cubic feet per tonne of biochar
* $40+ CAD/cubic foot on current market
* 5.2-6.5 cubic yards per tonne of biochar
* $200+ CAD per cubic yard of biochar

At 225 tonnes, half of the annual production, we have:

$234,000 - $292,500 CAD if sold in bulk
$1,260,000 - $1,530,000 CAD if sold in cubic foot bags

Once sales come online, this gives us a potential revenue stream of 225 tonnes of biochar which if we could sell it all could reasonably sell for between $234,000 CAD and $1,500,000 CAD per year. This would likely require an additional dedicated employee for packaging, but well worth the money. This wouldn't be available until biochar certification comes in from CFIA, which takes more than a year according to them. But once the sales come online that gives us a potential employee budget of upwards of $1.75 million CAD, enough for respectable career wages even if we need a few more employees do do everything we want to accomplish.

## üß™ MRV Readiness (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)

**Measured:**

* Input biomass (weight)
* Output biochar (dry weight)
* Quench water (volume)
* Emissions (chimney sensors)

**Tested:**

* Carbon content
* Moisture
* Ash
* Volatiles (PAHs)
* Heavy metals

Testing must meet Puro and CFIA requirements. Frequency may increase with feedstock variability.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Quench Water

* Stored for reuse or diluted for food forest
* Nutrient-rich if properly managed

## üîÑ Next Steps

* Prototype kiln and optimize size
* Design MRV-ready kiln building
* Develop automated quench/recovery system
* Finalize biochar crushing and transfer workflow
