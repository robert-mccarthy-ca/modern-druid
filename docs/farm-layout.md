# ðŸŒ³ Agroforestry Layout â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid farms are designed around syntropic agroforestry and natural farming principles to maximize biomass, biodiversity, food quality and long-term carbon sequestration.

## ðŸŒ± Initial Layout Strategy

Each 25-hectare block will feature:

- **Northâ€“south oriented rows**
- **10â€¯m wild buffers** on all sides
- **Central pond (~0.1 ha)** for irrigation and resilience
- Shared infrastructure near the pond:
  - Water harvesting system
  - Power and solar generation
  - KNF and JADAM input preparation area
  - Nursery site

The 25-hectare block size was selected to promote wildlife corridors approximately every half kilometre, enhancing biodiversity and allowing for unmanaged natural spaces. Adjacent blocks share a 20â€¯m combined wild buffer. Buffer zones will receive biochar, foliar feeds, and irrigation but will be left otherwise undisturbed.

Centralized infrastructure around the pond maximizes operational efficiency: water storage, nursery space, and input preparation facilities.

## ðŸŒ¾ Row Types and Planting Strategy
**Initial Planting**
- **Sunflowers**: Annual taproot openers, 1â€¯m grid spacing
- **Comfrey**: Perennial biomass species, 1â€¯m grid, offset between sunflowers
- **Daikon radish**: Additional annual taproot openers between sunflowers and comfrey
- **Groundcover mix**: Broadcast low-growing beneficial species (clover, yarrow, trefoil, purslane, etc.)
- **Biomass Trees**: Raised in nursery, transplanted into place after sunflowers are chopped

**Pre-Planting Workflow**:
- Sunflowers create initial vertical taproot pathways.
- Comfrey establishes deep perennial roots offset between sunflower points.
- Daikon radish assists rapid initial soil breakup.
- Diverse groundcover broadcast early for ground-layer biodiversity.
- Fall transplanting of nursery-raised biomass trees replaces chopped sunflowers.

**Row and Alley Planting**:
- Initial soil disturbance limited to a single trench pass for tree rows.
- All perennial crops established from nursery transplants; all others seeded by seedball.
- Alley structure:
  - Either 50% edible/medicinal trees + 50% biomass trees with full biomass alleys
  - Or 100% biomass tree rows with mixed edible/biomass alley crops
- As trees mature:
  - **Annual canopy lifting** through pruning
  - **Understory planting** beneath rising canopies
  - **Succession management** by removing overly tall or poorly adapted trees
- Annual planting cycles:
  - Constant introduction of new trees and plants
  - "Cull the weak, keep the strong" to evolve the site naturally
- Biodiversity prioritized:
  - Begin with natives, expand into adjacent climate analogs
  - Use all available plants, let nature sort out the winners

> Early emphasis on deep soil carbon establishment, followed by full vertical and horizontal biomass expansion.

## ðŸ§ª Soil and Foliar Inputs

- **Weekly JMS and IMO applications**
- **Annual biochar application** during snow-free periods and after pruning
- **Compost** composting via Johnson-Su bioreactors
- **KNF natural inputs** for foliar and soil drenches
- **Strict no-use policy** on pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and synthetic fertilizers

**Notes:**
- Frequent microbial and foliar inputs counter rapid soil evolution stresses.
- Weekly JMS/IMO applications ensure post-biochar inoculation without needing separate pre-inoculation steps.
- Local organic waste streams (e.g., sawdust, woodchips) used as mulch where biochar is unsuitable.

## ðŸ”„ Planting Phases

### Phase 1 â€“ Biomass & Soil Building
- Land clearing
- Early IMO and JMS inoculations
- Broadcasting seedballs and cover crops
- Establishing nursery operations

### Phase 2 â€“ Food Forest Structuring
- Single initial trencher pass for tree rows
- Fall transplanting of nursery-raised trees
- Seedball planting of diverse understory species
- Permanent alley and row organization
- Ongoing pruning and succession management

### Phase 3 â€“ Continuous Improvement and R&D
- **Irrigation**:
  - Automation of water delivery from surface/ground sources, expanding toward atmospheric harvesting
- **Biochar Production**:
  - Streamlining workflows with conveyors and grinding systems
- **Drone Use**:
  - Drone seeding, foliar applications, and field scouting for new sites
- **Breeding Program**:
  - Adapting plant lines to evolving biochar-rich, microbially active soils
- **Augmented Reality Integration**:
  - AR glasses/headsets for real-time visual planting grids and field data collection
- **Knowledge Documentation**:
  - Open-access publishing (YouTube, GitHub, etc.) for replicable carbon farming models

See [`docs/farm-rnd.md`](../farm-rnd.md) for expanded research and development goals.

> **This layout evolves continuously** â€” Field experimentation, soil data, and ecosystem feedback loops drive ongoing refinements.
