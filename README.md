# üåç The Modern Druid Project

**What would I do if I had the budget to stop climate collapse?**

Climate change isn‚Äôt coming ‚Äî it‚Äôs here. We‚Äôve already passed 1.5¬∞C. Permafrost isn‚Äôt just melting, it‚Äôs burning. Fires from 2023 are still burning today. We‚Äôve ignited the peat. The once-frozen carbon stores of the North are now fueling the very fires that release them.

**Is there any way forward that doesn't involve dying in the apocalypse?**

That‚Äôs what I wanted to know. Could I do something meaningful even if I had the money to start a company to do it? Not another greenwashed offset scheme. Not another bandaid. **Could I build something with existing tools and technologies that might actually matter?** Could we remove carbon from the atmosphere at the scale of **multiple parts per million per year**?

Here‚Äôs my attempt.

## üå± The Big Idea: Self-Replicating Carbon Farms

Introducing the **Modern Druid Project** ‚Äî a scalable blueprint for exponential climate action. The main service is starting self-replicating farms.

Each farm:

* Removes atmospheric carbon through **biochar + soil carbon sequestration**
* Purpose grown biomass for conversion to **biochar**, locking the carbon in solid form
* Grows **free food** using syntropic agroforestry and natural farming techniques **free from pesticides, herbicides or fungicides**
* Pays **real wages** through carbon credits and biochar revenue, 80% of revenue stays in the communities
* **Spawns new farms** as a built-in function, creating geometric growth through a permanent expansion budget
* The land and the food forest on it **passes to the farmers who built it** at the end of its project cycle

We‚Äôre not talking about monoculture plantations. These are **high-biomass food forests** designed to grow carbon, food, soil, and community. And do it profitably. No greenwashing. Legitimate carbon dioxide removal that you can see, touch, even taste for yourself, rooted in the soil. Paid for by international voluntary carbon markets that pay the same regardless of where you run the project, whether it's in a high income country like Canada (where I live) or an impoverished area like rural Kenya, bringing real prosperity to poorer communities. Channeling money and resources from polluters to the people who would heal the land.

## üí° What Makes It Different?

### üßä Climate-First

This model isn‚Äôt *about* food. It‚Äôs about stopping runaway climate change. Food is a **co-benefit**. But producing food lets us use agricultural land at scale to do this.

* **Primary crop:** Biomass for biochar
* **Secondary crops:** Edibles, medicine, biodiversity
* **Carbon revenue only**: Puro.Earth (biochar carbon credits), Verra + CCB (soil carbon credits), and biochar sales

### üí∏ Free Food, Forever

Why give food away?

* Eliminate harvest/sales logistics and farm design constraints.
* Build public trust and interest.
* Undercut the industrial chemical agriculture machine that's destroying the world's soils. Let's see them compete with free and organic. Drive them out of business, buy their land, start new farms.
* Food security for the communities they operate in. Forcing people to pay for the privilege of eating doesn't have to exist as a business model. Carbon can pay those bills.
* Be a source of regeneration and prosperity wherever we go, welcomed into and hopefully paid to set up carbon farms. Be a source of food security and cost savings to the communities along with wages.

> Let the people pick their own damn food. We're busy drawing down carbon.

### üåø The Land Returns to the Communities

Why give the land away? Why not just keep it forever?

* Farmers work a whole lot harder if it's their land they're improving.
* Be a source of regeneration and prosperity wherever we go, welcomed into and hopefully paid to set up carbon farms. Be a source of generational wealth for the people who would take up the mantle of carbon farmer. Make it a legitimate, sought after career.
* This isn't a new form of colonialism. It's regeneration. Both of the land and the communities.
* To be trusted and welcomed into communities across the world, we need to expand everywhere to have a chance of saving the planet.
* We come, we improve the soil, we draw down carbon, we feed the people, and then we leave. And we leave behind a legacy of fertility and prosperity in our wake. Business doesn't have to be exploitative to be profitable.

### üåø Agroforestry, Not Agriculture

Land is structured as:

* Tall **pollarded biomass trees** in structured rows
* Low/mid strata of edible and support species beneath
* Short rotation coppiced alleys
* Managed for **biomass production and mechanical harvesting**, not picking efficiency or maximizing food harvests

### üî• Biochar at Scale

We use **flame-cap kilns**, modified for automation and emissions monitoring:

* Loader-fed, tiltable, insulated kilns
* Quench automation
* MRV-compliant kiln sheds (ventilation + sensors)
* Crush, weigh, screen, apply
* Boosts soil water and nutrient retention
* Provides abundant microbial habitat

At least **50% of biochar** stays on site to build terra preta-like soils. The rest can be sold if markets exist.

Making biochar is actually fairly easy, it's the logistics of getting the biomass and selling that make it hard. We largely bypass those obstacles by growing our own biomass and using the biochar ourselves to improve our soils and grow more biomass.

### üß™ Natural Farming as Soil Engine

* JMS, IMO, FPJ, LAB applied continuously
* Boosts biodiversity, disease resistance, fertility
* No pesticides, no chemicals, no bullshit

### üíß Water Security Is Key

* Start with existing surface/groundwater
* Expand to **atmospheric water harvesting**
* Use **ponds, snowmaking, and smart irrigation**
* Becomes a **major part of the annual local development budget** as the site matures and inputs drop

No water = no food = no carbon. Irrigation resilience is non-negotiable in the face of radical climate change.

### üåç Universal Pay & Ownership

* 50% of revenue to employees, always
* No one earns more than 2√ó the lowest paid
* Farms **transfer to worker ownership after 20 years**
* Carbon farmers can retire with land and generational wealth

## üìà Can It Scale?

Yes. It‚Äôs built to. By having every farm self-replicating we grow at a rate of O(e^x), or in layman's terms, we have an exponential growth rate.

* **100‚Äì150 hectares** per site to hit Puro minimums (1000 t CO2/year)
* Estimated 10‚Äì20‚ÄØt‚ÄØCO‚ÇÇe/ha/year from soil + biochar combined
* 515 million hectares globally could remove **1 ppm CO‚ÇÇ/year**
* That‚Äôs **\~10% of global farmland**

With enough replication, by forcing out and replacing existing agricultural proactices, we could approach **ppm/month**. And that‚Äôs really where we need to be at this point. Every successful farm spawns new ones until we've run out of earth to heal.

We are limited by the size of the voluntary markets, so eventually to scale to global levels there needs to be a global price on carbon, probably at the UN scale. Showing that this works would go along way to making that happen.

> Carbon farming, scaled like software.

## üîß How It Works

### üî• Biochar System

* Flame cap kilns, automated for efficiency and safety
* Kiln buildings monitor emissions (CO‚ÇÇ, CO, VOCs, PM)
* Quench water recovered, reused in food forests
* Char is dried, weighed, screened, tested
* MRV-compliant from day one

### üå≥ Food Forest Design

* Syntropic agroforestry: dense, layered, successional
* High pollarded biomass trees in rows, food beneath
* Short rotation coppicing in the alleys between
* Minimal maintenance: prune, mulch, seed
* Edible plants self-harvested by locals

### üß¨ R\&D Engine

* Biomass breeding for yield and carbon
* Rock dust trials (enhanced rock weathering)
* Greenhouses heated by the biochar production for year round production regardless of weather
* Aquaculture, growing fish in the water storage for both plant nutrients and meat harvesting
* Education, free access to all of it. Training programs, engineering designs, everything.

### üè≠ Revenue Model

* Puro.Earth biochar credits
* Verra + CCB soil credits
* Optional biochar sales (once certified)

> Free food and enhanced soil fertility, paid for by polluters.

## üìä Financial Summary

### Revenue (per 1500 tonnes of biomass, 100 hectares at 15 tonnes/hectare):

* Biochar credits: \~\$264,000 CAD/year
* Soil credits: \$45,000‚Äì\$90,000 CAD/year
* Biochar sales: \$0‚Äì\$1.5M CAD (if market exists)

### Costs:

* Half of revenue to **employee wages and bonuses**
* Remainder split between:

  * Local infrastructure (30%)
  * Global R\&D (10%)
  * New farm launches (10%)

This is at $200 CAD and $45 CAD per ton of CO2 for biochar and soil respectively. $200 CAD/tonne has been a rough value for the past year or so on Puro.Earth's marketplace. $45/tonne CAD is an optimistic price based on the large number of co-benefits that typically bring in the higher value credits.

> Goal: Six-figure income potential for carbon farmers. Globally.

## üîÅ 20-Year Cycles

* **Years 1‚Äì20**: Revenue grows. Food is free. Carbon is pulled.
* **Year 20**: 
  - Ownership of half the land handed to the workers.
  - New land purchased and added to the project
* **Year 20-40**: Revenue grows. Food is free. Carbon is pulled.
* **Year 40**:
  - Ownership of the rest of the initial land is handed to the workers.
  - New Land purchased and added to the project
* New farms launched throughout using site budget.

At year 20, half the land is given to the workers who worked it. The other half gets renewed for another 20 years, along with any other land purchases that get added to the project. Every 20 years after that the oldest land is passed to the farmers and new land is added until there's no more local land to buy up. At which point it begins its final project cycle with the remainder of the land granted to it's final farmers.

It‚Äôs not colonization. It‚Äôs reparative. **Land returns to the people**, improved.

## üß© Where It Stands

No funding. No project. No company. Nothing. Just one guy's crazy idea.
I‚Äôm still refining the protocols, workflows, financials, R\&D list, and documentation now. The idea is to refine and develop it to the point where it's pitchable as a climate startup.

This repository contains:

* `README.md`: The big picture
* `farm-layout.md`: Agroforestry and food forest structure
* `financial-model.md`: Revenue and cost modelling
* `goals.md`: UN SDG alignment and impact targets
* `kiln-system.md`: Biochar kiln specs and throughput
* `mrv-protocols.md`: Carbon credit verification standards
* `long-term-projects-research-and-development.md`: Advanced R\&D roadmap

Everything here would be documented and releases for free. Training videos, engineering designs, parperwork examples, everything someone needs to do this themselves. Because when the world is finally ready to act, digitally is the only way to spread that information fast enough.

This is how I would solve it. This is the Modern Druid Project. 

And you know what? I think it might just have a chance of working. Dare to solve the problem.
