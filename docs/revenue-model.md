# ðŸ’¸ Revenue Model â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid farms generate revenue through multiple synergistic streams, primarily focused on verified carbon removal, biochar sales, and sustainable farm management.

This multi-stream model creates a resilient financial foundation, while keeping food free for communities and ensuring global scalability.

## ðŸŒ¿ Revenue Streams

### 1. **Soil Carbon Sequestration Credits (Verra + CCB)**

- **Method**: Deep soil carbon sequestration verified via direct sampling to 3 metres.
- **Volume**: 10â€“20 tonnes COâ‚‚e per hectare per year.
- **Pricing**: Target $45 CAD per tonne (aligned with high co-benefit CCB projects).
- **Scalability**: Limited only by the amount of farmland and labour available.

### 2. **Biochar Carbon Removal Credits (Puro.Earth)**

- **Method**: Biochar production from biomass grown onsite or sourced locally.
- **Volume**: Based on kiln capacity and burn schedule.
- **Pricing**: ~$200 CAD per tonne of COâ‚‚e stored (current Puro.Earth average).
- **Scalability**: Production scales with kiln infrastructure and biomass availability.

### 3. **Biochar Product Sales**

- **Method**: Certified CFIA/OMRI biochar sold for agricultural and horticultural use.
- **Product**: Packaged bulk or bagged biochar (e.g., 1 cubic foot bags). Can be sold either raw or preconditioned.
- **Pricing**: Estimated retail ~$0.50â€“$1.00 CAD per litre bulk equivalent.
- **Strategy**: Online direct-to-consumer sales, and potential B2B wholesaling.

## ðŸ“ˆ Revenue Stacking Model (Per 25 Hectares)

| Revenue Source            | Estimate (Annual)        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Soil Carbon Credits        | ~$16,875 CAD              |
| Biochar Carbon Credits     | Variable (based on production) |
| Biochar Sales              | Variable (based on market absorption) |

> **Note**: These revenues are from soil and biochar carbon credits, plus biochar sales. Timber harvests are not a primary revenue stream during the project life cycle, as tree rotation focuses on adaptive breeding over timber production. Timber sales may be an option for whoever inherits the site after the project completes, but not something that we will focus on.

## ðŸ§  Strategic Priorities

- **Early Phase**:
  - Focus on maximizing biochar production for carbon credits and soil application.
  - Seek industrial waste streams for increased biochar production capability.
  - Build baseline soil carbon for long-term soil credit revenue.

- **Mid Phase**:
  - Open limited biochar sales once CFIA/OMRI certification is secured, some is still required for the food forest, the rest can be sold.
  - Strengthen soil credit claims with multi-year MRV data.

- **Mature Phase**:
  - Prioritize breeding and selecting tree lines adapted to high-carbon, microbially active soils.
  - Continue generational replanting cycles to enhance soil performance and biodiversity.
  - Improve operational efficiency and reduce labour through automation.

# âœ… Conclusion

Modern Druid's regenerative system is designed for **resilient, stacked revenue from carbon** without compromising its mission to heal the land, pull carbon from the atmosphere, and provide free food access.

Every tree planted and every kilogram of biomass processed contributes to a financially and ecologically sustainable future.
