# ðŸŒ³ Agroforestry Layout â€“ Modern Druid

Modern Druid farms are designed around syntropic agroforestry and natural farming principles to maximize biomass, biodiversity, food quality and long-term carbon sequestration.

## ðŸŒ± Initial Layout Strategy

Each 25-hectare block will feature:

- **Northâ€“south oriented rows**
- **10â€¯m wild buffers** on all sides
- **Central pond (~0.1 ha)** for irrigation and resilience
- Shared infrastructure near the pond:
  - Water harvesting system
  - Power and solar generation
  - KNF and JADAM input preparation area
  - Nursery site

The 25-hectare block size was selected to promote wildlife corridors approximately every half kilometre, enhancing biodiversity and allowing for unmanaged natural spaces. Adjacent blocks share a 20â€¯m combined wild buffer. Buffer zones will receive biochar, foliar feeds, and irrigation but will be left otherwise undisturbed.

Centralized infrastructure around the pond maximizes operational efficiency: water storage, nursery space, and input preparation facilities.

## ðŸŒ¾ Row Types and Planting Strategy

**Initial Planting**
- **Sunflowers**: Annual taproot openers, 1â€¯m grid spacing
- **Comfrey**: Perennial biomass species, 1â€¯m grid, offset between sunflowers
- **Daikon radish**: Additional annual taproot openers between sunflowers and comfrey
- **Groundcover mix**: Broadcast low-growing beneficial species (clover, yarrow, trefoil, purslane, etc.) with a focus on anything with a deep taproot
- **Black Locust**: Either raised in nursery, transplanted into place after sunflowers are chopped, or planted with seedballs after chop

**Pre-Planting Workflow**:
- Sunflowers create initial vertical taproot pathways.
- Comfrey establishes deep perennial roots offset between sunflower points.
- Daikon radish assists rapid initial soil breakup.
- Diverse groundcover broadcast early for ground-layer biodiversity.
- Fall transplanting of nursery-raised biomass trees replaces chopped sunflowers, reusing the hole from the giant taproot that will now decompose.

**Row and Alley Planting**:
- Initial soil disturbance limited to a single trench pass for tree rows.
- Named cultivars established from nursery transplants; all others seeded by seedball.
- Alley structure:
  - Either 50% edible/medicinal trees + 50% biomass trees with full biomass alleys
  - Or 100% biomass tree rows with mixed edible/biomass alley crops
- As trees mature:
  - **Annual canopy lifting** through pruning
  - **Understory planting** beneath rising canopies
  - **Succession management** by removing overly tall, poorly adapted trees, or trees that have better genetic stock to replace them
- Annual planting cycles:
  - Constant introduction of new trees and plants
  - "Cull the weak, keep the strong" to evolve the site naturally
- Biodiversity prioritized:
  - Begin with natives, expand into adjacent climate analogs
  - Use all available plants, let nature sort out the winners
- Breeding stock:
  - selectively breed for our new and evolving soil conditions, because there's never been a modern terra-pretafied natural farming syntropic agroforestry system in place, so we'll need to breed our own seed stocks.
  - even plants that do not grow true from seed like apples should be part of a breeding program, although this may take keeping different taste profiles isolated to common areas to keep the genetics from merging. A tart apple should be placed near other tart apples for example.
  - breed for vigor, yield and biomass

> Early emphasis on deep soil carbon establishment, followed by full vertical and horizontal biomass expansion. We would start by punching deep taproots all across the land, focusing on deep rooted plants that produce minimal lateral root competition, and introducing all the microbial diversity we can harvest from the local environments.

## ðŸ§ª Soil and Foliar Inputs

- **Weekly JMS and IMO applications**
- **Annual biochar application** during snow-free periods and after pruning
- **Compost** composting via Johnson-Su bioreactors
- **KNF natural inputs** for foliar and soil drenches
- **Strict no-use policy** on pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and synthetic fertilizers

**Notes:**
- Frequent microbial and foliar inputs counter rapid soil evolution stresses.
- Weekly JMS/IMO applications ensure post-biochar inoculation without needing separate pre-inoculation steps.
- Local organic waste streams (e.g., sawdust, woodchips) used as mulch where biochar is unsuitable.

## ðŸ’µ Soil Carbon Revenue Model

- Syntropic agroforestry systems typically sequester **10â€“20 tonnes COâ‚‚e per hectare per year**.
- **For a 25-hectare block**:
  - **Conservative estimate**: 250 tCOâ‚‚e/year
  - **Moderate estimate**: 375 tCOâ‚‚e/year
  - **Aggressive estimate**: 500 tCOâ‚‚e/year

- Using a **target carbon credit price of $45 CAD per tonne** (Verra + CCB soil projects):

| Estimate | Annual Soil Carbon Revenue (CAD) |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative (10 tCOâ‚‚e/ha) | ~$11,250 |
| Moderate (15 tCOâ‚‚e/ha)     | ~$16,875 |
| Aggressive (20 tCOâ‚‚e/ha)   | ~$22,500 |

> **Note**: These revenues are from soil carbon credits only and can be stacked with biochar carbon credit revenues and biochar sales for a multi-stream income model.

## ðŸ§ª MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) Requirements

- **Initial baseline soil sampling** to **3 metres depth** across project blocks before planting.
- **Direct sampling method** for MRV:
  - Full 0â€“3â€¯m core samples, divided into depth segments (e.g., 0â€“30â€¯cm, 30â€“100â€¯cm, 100â€“300â€¯cm).
  - Carbon concentration, bulk density, and moisture content measured separately by depth.
- **Annual or biennial re-sampling**:
  - Always to full depth (3â€¯m) to capture deep carbon accumulation.
  - Higher effort but critical for scientific rigor, soil profile research, and long-term credibility.
- **Additional MRV steps**:
  - Georeferenced core locations
  - Regular photo documentation
  - Third-party lab analysis for soil organic carbon (SOC)

> Choosing full-depth direct sampling increases verification credibility, builds a world-class soil dataset, and strengthens future carbon credit prices.

- Ongoing pruning, canopy and succession management
- Biochar applications
- Mulch applications (non-kilnable biomass)

### Phase 3 â€“ Continuous Improvement and R&D
