# 🌿 Modern Druid

**Open-source carbon farming for a livable planet.**

Modern Druid is my attempt at creating a globally replicable, revenue-generating carbon farming model designed to sequester atmospheric carbon, restore degraded land, and provide free food to communities — all while paying workers fairly and preparing for global scale by 2030.

We combine biochar production, syntropic agroforestry, and natural farming methods to build climate resilience, enhance soil fertility, and create a blueprint for distributed carbon removal.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Profitability by 2030** from verified carbon removal credits and biochar sales
- **Full transparency** and open access to all workflows, designs, and verification methods
- **Non-exploitative revenue sharing**: 50% of all revenue goes to employees
- **Community-first food systems**: All food is free to the public
- **Global readiness**: All training materials will be deliverable online for fast replication when the world is ready to scale carbon farming

## 🔧 System Overview

### 🔥 Biochar Production
- Purpose-grown or waste biomass is converted to high-carbon biochar using insulated, tiltable "Ring of Fire" kilns.
- Moisture content and carbon stability verified for carbon credit markets.
- Quench water is reused or repurposed for irrigation.
- Certified for sale (CFIA, OMRI), with long-term application of unsold biochar to onsite soil.

### 🌳 Syntropic Agroforestry
- Food forest established using natural succession and multi-layer planting.
- Uses deep-rooted biomass crops, nitrogen fixers, and pollinator-support species.
- Agroforestry layout includes wild buffers, central water systems, and a grid for biodiversity and access.

### 🧪 Natural Farming Practices
- Inputs based on Korean Natural Farming (KNF) and JADAM
- Includes JMS, IMO collections, and various foliar feeds
- Applied continuously to build soil microbiology as soil succession progresses

## 💸 Revenue Model

Revenue streams include:
- **Puro.Earth** certified biochar carbon credits
- **Verra VCS + CCB** soil carbon credits
- **CFIA/OMRI approved biochar** for agricultural sale
- **Eventual timber harvests**

> Food is **never sold** by the farm itself — it is shared with the public, with excess harvestable by local businesses and entrepeneurs. Pick your own damn food, we're busy drawing down carbon.

## 💰 Revenue Allocation Model

Each site operates on a strict 20-year cycle with revenue shared as follows:

**Before Profitability**
- **50% to employees** - equitable wages and bonuses
- **50% to local site** - establishing the site

**After Profitability**
- **50% to employees** — equitable wages and bonuses
- **20% to the local site** — infrastructure, automation, irrigation, and resilience
- **10% to the global parent project** — R&D, administration, and global support
- **20% to remote expansion** — supports the creation of new farms (instead of expanding existing ones), every farm creates new farms for exponential growth

Once a site is fully developed and climate-hardened, any remaining profits may be shared:
- **50% of profits to employees**
- **Remaining 50% to the farm manager/franchisee**

After the 20 years is up, the farm goes to the farm manager. We give the land back when we're done with it, to the local people that worked it. Then we move on to the next patch of mismanaged farmland.

## 🧭 2030 Target

By 2030, Modern Druid aims to:
- Be fully profitable across multiple locations
- Host a publicly accessible training library and project kit
- Present a UN-ready case for carbon farming as a global-scale climate solution capable of drawing down multiple parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year by way of carbon markets

## 🤝 Contributing

This is meant to be a community-guided project — feel free to open issues, propose improvements, or fork it to build your own farm. This is still just one dude and a crazy idea at this point.

**Let’s farm carbon, feed people, and fix the planet.**

## 📜 License

None for now, but feel free to start your own farm based on this. If this project gets to the point of being coherent and launchable, I will update this to be something fairly permissive, I just have to go through all the options to pick the right one.
